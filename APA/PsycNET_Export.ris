N2  - Mental health has become a global problem, as over 300 million people worldwide suffer from depression and 200 million from anxiety disorders, which are ranked by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the first and sixth leading causes of disability, respectively. Due to the limited health resources, the traditional method of mental health diagnosis as one‐to‐one consultation is difficult to meet the needs of the large number of mental subhealth population. In this article, we propose a new method for mental health recognition that could identify potentially clinically significant symptoms of depression and anxiety based on daily gait. Eighty‐eight participants were recruited, and their gaits were recorded by a digital camera. Then they were required to complete two rating scales, the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ‐9) and the seven‐item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD‐7), to measure their depression and anxiety levels. Specifically, 18 key points of each individual's body trunk were captured from video, and both time‐domain features and frequency‐domain behavioral features were extracted for each key point. Lastly, machine‐learning algorithms were utilized to build the mental health recognition models. Results showed that the proposed method is feasible and effective, with a correlation coefficient of depression (measured by PHQ‐9) recognition above 0.5 and anxiety (measured by GAD‐7) recognition above 0.4, achieving medium correlation. This new, low‐cost, and convenient mental health recognition pattern could be applied in daily monitoring of mental health and large‐scale preliminary screening of mental diseases.

N2  - BackgroundSelf-harm is a significant public health issue, and both our understanding and ability to predict adverse outcomes are currently inadequate. The current study explores how preventative efforts could be aided through short-term prediction and modelling of risk factors for self-harm.MethodsPatients (72% female, Mage = 40.3 years) within an inpatient psychiatric facility self-reported their psychological distress, interpersonal circumstances, and wish to live and die on a daily basis during 3690 unique admissions. Hierarchical logistic regressions assessed whether daily changes in self-report and history of self-harm could predict self-harm, with machine learning used to train and test the model. To assess interrelationships between predictors, network and cross-lagged panel models were performed.ResultsIncreases in a wish to die (β = 1.34) and psychological distress (β = 1.07) on a daily basis were associated with increased rates of self-harm, while a wish to die on the day prior [odds ratio (OR) 3.02] and a history of self-harm (OR 3.02) was also associated with self-harm. The model detected 77.7% of self-harm incidents (positive predictive value = 26.6%, specificity = 79.1%). Psychological distress, wish to live and die, and interpersonal factors were reciprocally related over the prior day.ConclusionsShort-term fluctuations in self-reported mental health may provide an indication of when an individual is at-risk of self-harm. Routine monitoring may provide useful feedback to clinical staff to reduce risk of self-harm. Modifiable risk factors identified in the current study may be targeted during interventions to minimise risk of self-harm. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  -  Theoretical models propose that attentional biases might account for the maintenance of social anxiety symptoms. However, previous eye-tracking studies have yielded mixed results. One explanation is that existing studies quantify eye-movements using arbitrary, experimenter-defined criteria such as time segments and regions of interests that do not capture the dynamic nature of overt visual attention. The current study adopted the Eye Movement analysis with Hidden Markov Models (EMHMM) approach for eye-movement analysis, a machine-learning, data-driven approach that can cluster people’s eye-movements into different strategy groups. Sixty participants high and low in self-reported social anxiety symptoms viewed angry and neutral faces in a free-viewing task while their eye-movements were recorded. EMHMM analyses revealed novel associations between eye-movement patterns and social anxiety symptoms that were not evident with standard analytical approaches. Participants who adopted the same face-viewing strategy when viewing both angry and neutral faces showed higher social anxiety symptoms than those who transitioned between strategies when viewing angry versus neutral faces. EMHMM can offer novel insights into psychopathology-related attention processes. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - This article discusses the impact of big data practices and imaginaries on children’s media cultures. The range of IoT (Internet of Things) products for childhood includes such items as: baby wearables that monitor the baby’s biometric data, health parameters and behavioral patterns and sell the promise of “peace of mind” to anxious parents; smart watches that track children’s whereabouts; the Internet of Toys (IoToys), which includes dolls and teddy bears equipped with voice and image recognition, robots, drones or other mechanical toys that are remotely controlled and/or programmable through apps, puzzle and building blocks, arts-to-life products, outdoor physical toys and teddy bears that monitor the child’s health parameters. Thanks to network connectivity and sensors, these new playthings collect play data, along with personal data about children and their parents, and, potentially, data on the surrounding environment. The author argues for an understanding of datafication as a question of citizenship, that would recognize children and their parents as both passive and agentic data citizens. Theoretically and methodologically, this approach would attune children and media studies with the contemporary calls for a non-media-centric approach to datafication that contextualizes digital footprints within the texture of everyday life.

N2  - Well-being is the characteristic of humans to feel well with themselves and their environment. A key driver of wellbeing is to have a healthy mind. Stress management, positive emotions, and empathic social interaction get us closer to this goal. The only sustainable way towards wellbeing is by maintaining a healthy lifestyle. In summary, technologies supporting this objective should measure and intervene "life" itself! The good news is that we are in a unique position to challenge the way technology can become a driver of wellbeing. Internet of things (IoT), Big Data, Affective Computing and Critical Engineering, are the key enablers. With pervasive data, interventions can evolve from being reactive to predictive. We could design long-term interventions that foster good habits, resilience, and personal growth. We encapsulate technologies in two parts: "Conceptualization and Sensor-less Sensing" and "Opportunistic Interventions." The former uses data streams to investigate and measure human traits and trends. The latter repurposes popular apps, devices, and environments into effective interventions. In summary, we aim at designing well-being technology that could survive the chasm of adoption. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - This article proposes an optical measurement of movement applied to data from video recordings of facial expressions of emotion. The approach offers a way to capture motion adapted from the film industry in which markers placed on the skin of the face can be tracked with a pattern-matching algorithm. The method records and postprocesses raw facial movement data (coordinates per frame) of distinctly placed markers and is intended for use in facial expression research (e.g., microexpressions) in laboratory settings. Due to the explicit use of specifically placed, artificial markers, the procedure offers the simultaneous measurement of several emotionally relevant markers in a (psychometrically) objective and artifact-free way, even for facial regions without natural landmarks (e.g., the cheeks). In addition, the proposed procedure is fully based on open-source software and is transparent at every step of data processing. Two worked examples demonstrate the practicability of the proposed procedure: In Study 1(N = 39), the participants were instructed to show the emotions happiness, sadness, disgust, and anger, and in Study 2 (N = 113), they were asked to present both a neutral face and the emotions happiness, disgust, and fear. Study 2 involved the simultaneous tracking of 14 markers for approximately 12 min per participant with a time resolution of 33 ms. The measured facial movements corresponded closely to the assumptions of established measurement instruments (EMFACS, FACSAID, Friesen & Ekman, 1983; Ekman & Hager, 2002). In addition, the measurement was found to be very precise with sub-second, sub-pixel, and sub-millimeter accuracy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Aims: This paper is a report on the effectiveness of a self‐management programme based on the self‐efficacy construct, in older people with heart failure. Background: Heart failure is a major health problem worldwide, with high mortality and morbidity, making it a leading cause of hospitalization. Heart failure is associated with a complex set of symptoms that arise from problems in fluid and sodium retention. Hence, managing salt and fluid intake is important and can be enhanced by improving patients' self‐efficacy in changing their behaviour. Design: Randomized controlled trial. Methods: Heart failure patients attending cardiac clinics in northern Taiwan from October 2006–May 2007 were randomly assigned to two groups: control (n = 46) and intervention (n = 47). The intervention group received a 12‐week self‐management programme that emphasized self‐monitoring of salt/fluid intake and heart failure‐related symptoms. Data were collected at baseline as well as 4 and 12 weeks later. Data analysis to test the hypotheses used repeated‐measures ANOVA models. Results: Participants who received the intervention programme had significantly better self‐efficacy for salt and fluid control, self‐management behaviour and their heart failure‐related symptoms were significantly lower than participants in the control group. However, the two groups did not differ significantly in health service use. Conclusion: The self‐management programme improved self‐efficacy for salt and fluid control, self‐management behaviours, and decreased heart failure‐related symptoms in older Taiwanese outpatients with heart failure. Nursing interventions to improve health‐related outcomes for patients with heart failure should emphasize self‐efficacy in the self‐management of their disease.

N2  - [Correction Notice: An erratum for this article was reported in Vol 71(6) of Biological Psychiatry (see record 2012-05342-016). In the original article, the authors have discovered an inaccuracy regarding how the fMRI analysis was conducted (see Data Analysis section, page 1040). Upon discovery of this error, the authors performed a re-analysis of incongruent vs. congruent conditions with correct trials only, as indicated by the original statement. The authors also provide a summary of these new results in the erratum.] Background: Exaggerated concern for correct performance has been linked to hyperactivity of the medial frontal cortex (MFC) in adult obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), but the role of the MFC during the early course of illness remains poorly understood. We tested whether hyperactive MFC-based performance monitoring function relates to altered MFC connectivity within task control and default mode networks in pediatric patients. Methods: Eighteen pairs of OCD and matched healthy youth underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging during performance monitoring and at rest. Task-related hyperactivations in the posterior and ventral MFC were used as seeds for connectivity analyses during task and resting state. Results: In posterior MFC, patients showed greater activation of dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) than control subjects, with greater activation predicting worse performance. In ventral MFC, control subjects exhibited deactivation, whereas patients activated this region. Compared with control subjects, patients showed increased dACC-ventral MFC connectivity during task and decreased dACC-right anterior operculum and ventral MFC-posterior cingulate connectivity during rest. Conclusions: Excessive activation and increased interactions of posterior and ventral MFC during performance monitoring may combine with reduced resting state connectivity of these regions within networks for task control and default mode to reflect early markers of OCD. Alteration of reciprocal interactions between these networks could potentiate the intrusion of ventral MFC-based affectively laden, self-referential thoughts, while disrupting posterior MFC-based performance-monitoring function in young patients.

N2  - Sentiment analysis of microblogging texts can facilitate both organisations’ public opinion monitoring and governments’ response strategies development. Nevertheless, most of the existing analysis methods are conducted on Twitter, lacking of sentiment analysis of Chinese microblogging (Weibo), and they generally rely on a large number of manually annotated training or machine learning to perform sentiment classification, yielding with difficulties in application. This paper addresses these problems and employs a sentiment ontology model to examine sentiment analysis of Chinese microblogging. We conduct a sentiment analysis of all public microblogging posts about ‘7.23 Wenzhou Train Collision’ broadcasted by Sina microblogging users between 23 July and 1 August 2011. For every day in this time period, we first extract eight dimensions of sentiment (expect, joy, love, surprise, anxiety, sorrow, angry, and hate), and then build fuzzy sentiment ontology based on HowNet and semantic similarity for sentiment analysis; we also establish computing methods of influence and sentiment of microblogging texts; and we finally explore the change of public sentiment after ‘7.23 Wenzhou Train Collision’. The results show that the established sentiment analysis method has excellent application, and the change of different emotional values can reflect the success or failure of guiding the public opinion by the government.

N2  - Telehealth has become a very important tool that allows the monitoring of heart failure patients in a home environment. However, little is known about the effect that such monitoring systems have on patients’ compliance, evolution and self-care behaviour. In particular, the effect that the selected user interface has on these factors is unknown. This study aims to investigate this, and to determine some practicalities that must be considered when designing and implementing a telehealth programme for heart failure. To achieve this, daily measurements of blood pressure, pulse, SpO2 and weight were collected from 534 patients suffering from heart failure. In addition, they were asked to fill in the European heart failure self-care behaviour scale questionnaire and the EQ-5D quality of life questionnaire, before and after the monitoring period. Two telehealth systems were used, the Motiva platform provided by Philips and the standalone unit provided by Docobo, the Doc@Home system. Significant differences were found between both systems concerning the compliance and adherence of patients. Moreover, a general, positive effect of telehealth was identified due to the fact that patients showed an increased self-awareness when managing their condition. These findings are supported by behavioural changes and a better understanding of heart failure from the patients’ perspective. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Risk research has theorized a number of mechanisms that might trigger, prolong, or potentially alleviate individuals' distress following terrorist attacks. These mechanisms are difficult to examine in a single study, however, because the social conditions of terrorist attacks are difficult to simulate in laboratory experiments and appropriate preattack baselines are difficult to establish with surveys. To address this challenge, we propose the use of computational focus groups and a novel analysis framework to analyze a social media stream that archives user history and location. The approach uses time‐stamped behavior to quantify an individual's preattack behavior after an attack has occurred, enabling the assessment of time‐specific changes in the intensity and duration of an individual's distress, as well as the assessment of individual and social‐level covariates. To exemplify the methodology, we collected over 18 million tweets from 15,509 users located in Paris on November 13, 2015, and measured the degree to which they expressed anxiety, anger, and sadness after the attacks. The analysis resulted in findings that would be difficult to observe through other methods, such as that news media exposure had competing, time‐dependent effects on anxiety, and that gender dynamics are complicated by baseline behavior. Opportunities for integrating computational focus group analysis with traditional methods are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - [Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 55 of Cognitive Systems Research (see record 2019-15769-021). One original Table published in the paper were incorrect. The correct table is given in the erratum.] Facial expression recognition in a wild situation is a challenging problem in computer vision research due to different circumstances, such as pose dissimilarity, age, lighting conditions, occlusions, etc. Numerous methods, such as point tracking, piecewise affine transformation, compact Euclidean space, modified local directional pattern, and dictionary-based component separation have been applied to solve this problem. In this paper, we have proposed a deep learning–based automatic wild facial expression recognition system where we have implemented an incremental active learning framework using the VGG16 model developed by the Visual Geometry Group. We have gathered a large amount of unlabeled facial expression data from Intelligent Technology Lab (ITLab) members at Inha University, Republic of Korea, to train our incremental active learning framework. We have collected these data under five different lighting conditions: good lighting, average lighting, close to the camera, far from the camera, and natural lighting and with seven facial expressions: happy, disgusted, sad, angry, surprised, fear, and neutral. Our facial recognition framework has been adapted from a multi-task cascaded convolutional network detector. Repeating the entire process helps obtain better performance. Our experimental results have demonstrated that incremental active learning improves the starting baseline accuracy from 63% to average 88% on ITLab dataset on wild environment. We also present extensive results on face expression benchmark such as Extended Cohn-Kanade Dataset, as well as ITLab face dataset captured in wild environment and obtained better performance than state-of-the-art approaches.

N2  - In this paper we propose a new technology able to map the underlying connection scheme among several psychological variables in a single individual. Nine patients with chronic heart failure underwent at regular intervals, two electronic questionnaires to evaluate depression (STAI—short form) and anxiety (STAY-6). Individual semantic maps were developed by Auto Contractive Map, a new data mining tool based on an artificial neural networks acting on the small data set formed by questionnaires items applied serially along time. The clinical psychologist involved in the clinical evaluation of the cases was asked to score the consistency between the information emerging from the graph depicting the structure of the main relationships among items and the clinical picture resulting from the psychological colloquium. All cases reported overall judgments of a good consistency suggesting that the mathematical architecture of the system is able to capture in the dynamics of items value variations through time the underlying construct of the patient psychological status. This technology is promising in remote monitoring of patients’ psychological condition in different settings with the possibility to implement personalized psychological interventions.

N2  - Background: As a result of innovations in the digitalization of healthcare new technologies, such as remote sensoring are gaining in importance for the collection of real-life data in addition to the regular medical examination. This enables a closer view into the daily lives of patients with multiple sclerosis and a more detailed monitoring of disease progression. Objective: This article gives a summary of sensor-based measurement technologies in the field of multiple sclerosis Results: A wide variety of sensor-based measurement technologies are already available, which largely focus on gait analysis and mobility. Furthermore, there are many innovative approaches for a sensor-based collation of the multifocal symptoms of multiple sclerosis, for example technologies focus on the area of stress surveillance, the autonomic nervous system, GPS tracking and sleep monitoring. Discussion: Despite the existence of many already available technologies, the aim is now to find a practical way to integrate them into the daily routine of patient monitoring, which includes standardized data collection, evaluation and interpretation. Only at this point a perspective benefit for treating physicians and patients can be achieved. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - This dissertation examines how computational interaction design has been influenced by theories of emotion drawn from the psychological sciences, and argues that the contemporary field of interaction design would be impossible without the developments in psychology that allowed human emotions to be understood as orderable and classifiable. Interaction design, or the process by which digital media are created and modified for human use, has grappled with theories of human emotion since its inception in the early 1980s. The project examines how the longer histories of psychology and psychiatry have changed conceptualizations of emotion in relation to cognition and behavior, and how shifts in these theories have shaped the development of a burgeoning array of digital tools for tracking and managing human emotions. Examining the continuum of humans and machines desired and configured by individuals throughout this history, the project explores how these subject identities, both imagined and made, have reflected broader changes in the exercise of social and political power and authority. The research draws on materials from several archives, including newspaper reports; the published works and archival materials of psychologists and computer science researchers; materials from the West Coast Computer Faire trade show in the late 1970s; interviews with designers; and psychological texts and textbooks. Alongside a design assessment of smartphone apps for mood tracking grounded in Values in Design (VID) scholarship, the project deploys historical, philosophical, and qualitative methods, including close reading and discursive and thematic analysis. The key mechanism for understanding emotion's role in digital media design is the drive to make human feelings both technically ordinal and scalable. Through these conceptual mechanisms, human feelings have become increasingly classifiable not only horizontally as different categorical types, but also hierarchically in ways that differentiate and assign value to the emotions and moods of individuals in relation to a larger mass of data. Accomplished through both natural and symbolic language, these mechanisms combine qualitative and quantitative modes of classification, enabling contemporary sociotechnical phenomena ranging from personal applications for digital mood tracking to the analysis of emotional "Big Data" by social media platforms.

N2  - About 30% of diabetes patients suffer from varying degrees of depression. Diabetes itself is associated with abnormal carbohydrate and energy metabolism. Whether chronic stress-induced depression-like behavior impacts the metabolome of blood plasma and urine in diabetes is not clear. This study aimed to investigate the effect of chronic stress on metabolome of plasma and urine in spontaneously diabetic Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats. The GK rats were subjected to 8 weeks' chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) to induce depression-like behavior. Metabolome analysis of blood plasma and urine using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS) was performed. Multivariate data analysis was used to evaluate the data. Behavior and biochemical assay confirmed the successful establishment of CUMS-induced depression-like behavior model in rats. Disturbance of 20 plasma metabolites and 16 urine metabolites were altered in CUMS-induced depression GK rats as compared to control ones. These disturbed metabolites were involved in fatty acid metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism, phenylalanine metabolism, citrate cycle, glycolysis, glutathione metabolism, and nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism. This study suggest that chronic stress-induced depression-like behavior may further disturb diabetes-itself energy metabolome. The plasma and urine lipid metabolites monitoring may be useful for early detection of depression in patients with diabetes mellitus. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Continuous glucose monitors (CGM) are becoming a norm for type 1 diabetes management and provide the opportunity to describe hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events experienced by people with type 1 diabetes (T1Ds). This dissertation had four objectives: 1) derive scales from the Hypoglycemia Fear Survey--Behavior (HFS-B) scale that represent unique constructs of hypoglycemia- related behavior, 2) describe the frequency and severity of CGM- measured hypoglycemic events, and assess how these relate to levels of hypoglycemia- related behaviors, 3) develop severity categories for CGM- measured hyperglycemic events and describe how the severity categories relate to A1C, and 4) collate insulin pump and CGM data to describe how participants at different levels of A1C use insulin boluses to manage their hyperglycemic events. Methods: Four analyses were conducted using CGM, insulin pump, demographic, and HFS-B data collected over 26 weeks from 216 T1Ds in the REPLACE-BG trial. The first was a psychometric analysis of the HFS-B. The second identified and measured hypoglycemic events and assessed how these events related to hypoglycemia-related behaviors. The third identified hyperglycemic events, categorized them by severity, and assessed how measures of hyperglycemic event severity predict A1C, the standard measure of glucose control. The fourth identified hyperglycemic events in which insulin boluses were administered and assessed the association of proactive insulin bolusing with the occurrence of severe hyperglycemic events. Results: Three scales were derived from the HFS-B, labelled hypoglycemia avoidance, reaction, and prevention behavior. Higher levels of hypoglycemia prevention behavior were associated with a lower percentage and shorter duration of moderate hypoglycemic events. Four categories of hyperglycemic event severity were developed, and those in the best glucose control (A1C &le; 7.1) had 1) a larger percent occurrence of non-severe hyperglycemic events and 2) a smaller percentage of time in the most severe event category. Finally, those in the best glucose control were more likely to practice proactive bolusing to prevent severe hyperglycemic events. Conclusion.: This analysis demonstrated the importance of CGM data in its continuous form. CGM identifies behaviors associated with prevention of both hypo- and hyperglycemia, which are preferentially performed by those with the best glucose control.

N2  - Treatment with opioid medications is a common treatment plan in acute care. Opioid medications cause sedation as a common side-effect; and respiratory depression, respiratory failure, and respiratory arrest as a less common but more dangerous adverse reactions. The Michigan Opioid Safety Score (MOSS) offers a tool to assess patients risk status for opioid-induced respiratory depression. The MOSS tool also includes a respiratory rate score and a sedation level score that cumulatively with the health risk generate the MOSS score. The scoring includes recommended interventions to prevent the occurrence of opioid-induced respiratory distress. The MOSS tool was implemented in three intensive care units (ICUs) to evaluate its use in non-intubated patients receiving opioid medications and its effect on Narcan administration rates as a proxy for the occurrence of opioid-induced respiratory depression (OIRD) near-miss events. The data analysis showed a non-significant reduction in the rate of Narcan administration, and a significant reduction in the rate of rapid response events. The lack of significance in the data analysis is likely due to the short length of the project. Facility-wide implementation would improve patient health outcomes through improved assessment of patients at high risk for OIRD events and standardize monitoring and assessment of all un-intubated patients receiving treatment with opioid medications. Capnography monitoring is recommended for patients found to be at high risk to prevent hypercapnic respiratory failure. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Individual differences in reward‐related processes, such as reward responsivity and approach motivation, appear to play a role in the nature and course of depression. Prior work suggests that cognitive biases for valenced information may contribute to these reward processes. Yet there is little work examining how biased attention, processing, and memory for positively and negatively valenced information may be associated with reward‐related processes in samples with depression symptoms. Methods: We used a data‐driven, machine learning (elastic net) approach to identify the best predictors of self‐reported reward‐related processes using multiple tasks of attention, processing, and memory for valenced information measured across behavioral, eye tracking, psychophysiological, and computational modeling approaches (n = 202). Participants were adults (ages 18–35) who ranged in depression symptom severity from mild to severe. Results: Models predicted between 5.0–12.2% and 9.7–28.0% of held‐out test sample variance in approach motivation and reward responsivity, respectively. Low self‐referential processing of positively valenced information was the most robust, albeit modest, predictor of low approach motivation and reward responsivity. Conclusions: Self‐referential processing of positive information is the strongest predictor of reward responsivity and approach motivation in a sample ranging from mild to severe depression symptom severity. Experiments are now needed to clarify the causal relationship between self‐referential processing of positively valenced information and reward processes in depression.

N2  - Background Admission to Intensive Care Units (ICU) exposures family members to a new environment, advanced monitoring systems and aggressive treatments. This is coupled with the critical condition of the patient being admitted in ICU. In such times of stress and crisis, families have varying experiences as they navigate the ICU journey. These happen more or less in chronological phases. Aim This review sought to describe the experiences of family members of patients admitted in adult ICUs. Data sources Four electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Scopus and Web of Science) were searched, using keywords and free‐text words. Methods Curation of the review question involved problem identification, a scoping search, developing a search strategy, evaluation, data analysis, and reporting. Freehand search in reference lists of eligible articles was also done to obtain potentially eligible articles published in English language between 2007 and 2018. Studies were included if they reported on family members’ experiences in adult ICUs. This review conforms to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta‐Analysis (PRISMA). Results Upon completion of the screening process, 28 studies were included. Most studies were conducted in the United States while no study was identified from Africa. We report on 717 family members. Family members’ experience of the ICU journey falls into three main themes: (i) Floating, (ii) Probing and (iii) Continuity or Closure. Conclusion As healthcare technology advances, the ICU environment consequently needs to evolve. As such, healthcare providers will need to adjust their practice, support and consider the patients’ family as the other part of the patient and members of the care team in order to meet their expectations. Further research highlighting family members’ experience of the ICU journey in Africa is needed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - As the challenge of mental health problems such as anxiety and depression increasing today, more convenient, objective, real-time assessing techniques of mental state are in need. The Microsoft Kinect camera is a possible option for contact lessly capturing human gait, which could reflect the walkers' mental state. So we tried to propose a novel method for monitoring individual's anxiety and depression based on the Kinect-recorded gait pattern. In this study, after finishing the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), 179 participants were required to walked on the footpath naturally while shot by the Kinect cameras. Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) were conducted to extract features from the Kinect-captured gait data after preprocessing, and different machine learning algorithms were used to train the regression models recognizing anxiety and depression levels, and the classification models detecting the cases with specific depressive symptoms. The predictive accuracies of the regression models achieved medium to large level: The correlation coefficient between predicted and questionnaire scores reached 0.51 on anxiety (by epsilon-Support Vector Regression, e-SVR) and 0.51 on depression (by Gaussian Processes, GP). The predictive accuracies could be even higher, 0.74 on anxiety (by GP) and 0.64 on depression (by GP), while training and testing the models on the female sample. The classification models also showed effectiveness on detecting the cases with some symptoms. These results demonstrate the possibility to recognize individual's questionnaire measured anxiety/depression levels and some depressive symptoms based on Kinect-recorded gait data through machine learning method. This approach shows the potential to develop non-intrusive, low-cost methods for monitoring individuals' mental health in real time. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - This article describes the results of field studies performed over a period between five months and 24 months. The objectives of these studies were to collect long-term real-life data to evaluate how these data can be mapped to items on standardized assessment tests and which presentation method is most suitable to inform caregivers about critical situations and changes in health or care needs. A Home-monitoring system which uses modern sensor technologies was developed for and used in these field studies. It was installed in living environments of seven people (three who were not in need of care, two in need of care, and two with mental disabilities). The data were generated by sensor data acquisition and questionnaire reporting. Four types of data analysis and representation were evaluated to support caregivers. Results show that sensor data can be used to determine information directly or indirectly, which can be mapped to relevant assessment items and presented with different degrees of granularity. It is also feasible to determine and present additional information of potential interest which cannot be directly mapped to any assessment item. Sensor data can also be displayed in a live view. This live data representation led to a decrease in the caregivers’ workload when assessed according to the German version of the Perceived Stress Questionnaire.

N2  - Information communication technology (ICT) is required in the field of agriculture to solve problems arising because of the aging of farmers and shortage of heirs. In particular, environmental sensors and cameras are widely used in existing agricultural support systems for easy data collection. Although the traditional purpose of these systems is naive monitoring and controlling of the environment, the propagation of advanced cultivation is now expected by applying the data to machine learning and data mining technologies. Therefore, we propose a novel multi-modal sliding window-based support vector regression (multi-modal SW-SVR) method for accurate prediction of complicated water stress, which is a plant status, from two data types, namely environmental and plant image data. The proposed method includes two methodologies, SW-SVR and deep neural network (DNN) as a multi-modal feature extractor for SW-SVR. SW-SVR, which we proposed previously, is a suitable learning method for data with time-dependent characteristics, such as plant status. Moreover, we propose a new image feature, remarkable moving objects detected by adjacent optical flow (ROAF), to enable DNN to extract essential features easily for predicting water stress. Compared with existing regression models and features, the proposed multi-modal SW-SVR with ROAF demonstrates more precise and stable water stress prediction.

N2  - Comorbid insomnia is experienced by over half of heart failure (HF) patients and is associated with poorer health-related quality of life, elevated depression, daytime fatigue, excessive daytime sleepiness, and diminished functional performance. HF patients also experience deficits across several cognitive domains, including attention, memory, executive functioning, and psychomotor functioning, and these deficits appear to be exacerbated by the presence of insomnia. Initial investigations in HF patients document the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia in reducing insomnia symptoms and daytime fatigue. However, such interventions require substantial time and energy investments. Due to the high symptom burden of HF, there exists a need for interventions that provide similar treatment benefits for insomnia, but with fewer time and physical endurance demands on patients. This study was designed to 1) evaluate the treatment effects of Brief Behavioral Treatment for Insomnia (BBTI) on insomnia among HF patients, 2) examine the relationship between insomnia, cognitive function, and decision-making in HF patients at baseline, and 3) evaluate the effects of BBTI on relevant correlates of insomnia in HF patients, including cognitive functioning, decision-making, distress, self-care, quality of life, and functional status. Twenty-three patients with HF and comorbid insomnia (70% women; 65% white; mean age = 55.7 &#xb1; 11.3 years; NYHA Class III = 61%) were recruited from outpatient clinics and cardiac rehabilitation programs at Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center and through Research Match. Participants were prescreened for eligibility based on HF diagnosis and current symptoms, with presence of at least mild insomnia. Screening excluded patients with other untreated sleep disorders or psychiatric disorders contraindicated for BBTI. All participants completed two-week sleep diaries followed by baseline assessment and randomization to one of two conditions, a sleep monitoring (SM) control group (n = 11) or a behavioral intervention (BI) group (n = 12). BI participants completed the manualized BBTI intervention across four weekly sessions while SM participants received no contact during this time. After the intervention, all participants completed a second two-week sleep diary followed by a final assessment. The primary mode of data analysis was repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance. Results indicated that BI participants experienced significant improvements in insomnia symptoms, sleep quality, and sleep efficiency, while SM participants did not change. Post-intervention, 58% of participants in the BI group experienced clinically meaningful reductions in insomnia symptoms, with 27.3% achieving complete remission. BI participants also experienced improvements in depression, anxiety, and HF-related quality of life, whereas SM participants did not. At baseline there was no association between insomnia symptoms and cognitive functioning or decision-making, nor were there treatment effects on these outcomes. Neither BI nor SM participants experienced changes in HF self-care or functional status across the study period. Results of this study support the efficacy of BBTI for treatment of insomnia in HF patients. These data represent the first successful application of the BBTI intervention in a disease-specific population. The brief intervention demonstrated a high degree of acceptability within this symptom-limited patient population and was effective in improving insomnia, distress, and quality of life.

N2  - Objective: Within the context of the United States opioid epidemic, some parents often fear the use of opioids to help manage their children's postoperative pain. As a possible consequence, parents often do not dispense optimal analgesic medications to their children after surgery, putting their children at risk of suffering from postsurgical pain. The objective of this research was to assess ethnicity as a predictor of both pain and opioid consumption, and to examine how Hispanic/Latinx and Non-Hispanic White parents alter their child's opioid consumption in response to significant postsurgical pain. Methods: Participants were 254 children undergoing outpatient tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy surgery and their parents. Longitudinal multilevel modeling examined changes in both parent-reported pain and hydrocodone/APAP consumption (mg/kg) on days 1 to 7 after surgery. Results: Parent reports of postoperative pain were higher in Hispanic/Latinx patients compared to their Non-Hispanic White counterparts (β = −0.15; 95% CI: −0.28, −0.01). There was also a significant interaction of ethnicity and pain on opioid consumption (β = 0.07; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.13). The relationship between parent perceived pain and opioid use was stronger for Non-Hispanic White children, suggesting that this group was more likely to consume opioids to help manage clinically significant postsurgical pain. Conclusions: Hispanic/Latinx children might be at risk for undertreatment of surgical pain. Findings highlight the importance of assessing parent background and cultural beliefs as predictors of at home pain management and the potential effectiveness of tailored interventions that educate parents about monitoring and treating child postoperative pain.

N2  - Background: Postsurgical patients experiencing opioid‐related adverse drug events have 55% longer hospital stays, 47% higher costs associated with their care, 36% increased risk of 30‐day readmission, and 3.4 times higher risk of inpatient mortality compared to those with no opioid‐related adverse drug events. Most of the adverse events are preventable. General Aim: This study explored three types of electronic monitoring devices (pulse oximetry, capnography, and minute ventilation [MV]) to determine which were more effective at identifying the patient experiencing respiratory compromise and, further, to determine whether algorithms could be developed from the electronic monitoring data to aid in earlier detection of respiratory depression. Materials and Methods: A study was performed in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) in an inner city. Sixty patients were recruited in the preoperative admissions department on the day of their surgery. Forty‐eight of the 60 patients wore three types of electronic monitoring devices while they were recovering from back, neck, hip, or knee surgery. Machine learning models were used for the analysis. Results: Twenty‐four of the 48 patients exhibited sustained signs of opioid‐induced respiratory depression (OIRD). Although the SpO2 values did not change, end‐tidal CO2 levels increased, and MV decreased, representing hypoventilation. A machine learning model was able to predict an OIRD event 10 min before the actual event occurred with 80% accuracy. Linking Evidence to Action: Electronic monitoring devices are currently used as a tool to assess respiratory status using thresholds to distinguish when respiratory depression has occurred. This study introduces a potential paradigm shift from a reactive approach to a proactive approach that would identify a patient at high risk for OIRD. Capnography and MV were found to be effective tools in detecting respiratory compromise in the PACU. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Reports an error in "Altered function and connectivity of the medial frontal cortex in pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder" by Kate Dimond Fitzgerald, Emily R. Stern, Mike Angstadt, Karen C. Nicholson-Muth, McKenzie R. Maynor, Robert C. Welsh, Gregory L. Hanna and Stephan F. Taylor (Biological Psychiatry, 2010[Dec][1], Vol 68[11], 1039-1047). In the original article, the authors have discovered an inaccuracy regarding how the fMRI analysis was conducted (see Data Analysis section, page 1040). Upon discovery of this error, the authors performed a re-analysis of incongruent vs. congruent conditions with correct trials only, as indicated by the original statement. The authors also provide a summary of these new results in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2010-23802-016). Background: Exaggerated concern for correct performance has been linked to hyperactivity of the medial frontal cortex (MFC) in adult obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), but the role of the MFC during the early course of illness remains poorly understood. We tested whether hyperactive MFC-based performance monitoring function relates to altered MFC connectivity within task control and default mode networks in pediatric patients. Methods: Eighteen pairs of OCD and matched healthy youth underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging during performance monitoring and at rest. Task-related hyperactivations in the posterior and ventral MFC were used as seeds for connectivity analyses during task and resting state. Results: In posterior MFC, patients showed greater activation of dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) than control subjects, with greater activation predicting worse performance. In ventral MFC, control subjects exhibited deactivation, whereas patients activated this region. Compared with control subjects, patients showed increased dACC-ventral MFC connectivity during task and decreased dACC-right anterior operculum and ventral MFC-posterior cingulate connectivity during rest. Conclusions: Excessive activation and increased interactions of posterior and ventral MFC during performance monitoring may combine with reduced resting state connectivity of these regions within networks for task control and default mode to reflect early markers of OCD. Alteration of reciprocal interactions between these networks could potentiate the intrusion of ventral MFC-based affectively laden, self-referential thoughts, while disrupting posterior MFC-based performance-monitoring function in young patients.

N2  - Anxiety disorders afflict almost 7.3 percent of the world’s population. One in 14 people will experience anxiety disorder at the given year. When associated with mood disorders, anxiety can also trigger or increase other diseases’ symptoms and effects, like depression and suicidal behavior. Binaural beats are a low-frequency type of acoustic stimulation perceived when the individual is subjected to two slightly different wave frequencies, from 200 to 900 Hz. Binaural beats can contribute to anxiety reduction and modification of other psychological conditions and states, modifying cognitive processes and mood states. In this work, we applied a 5 Hz binaural beat to 6 different subjects, to detect a relevant change in their brainwaves before and after the stimuli. We applied 20 min stimuli in 10 separated sessions. We assessed the differences using a Multi-Layer Perceptron classifier in comparison with non-parametric tests and Low-Resolution Brain Electromagnetic Tomography (eLORETA). eLORETA showed remarkable changes in High Alpha. Both eLORETA and MLP approaches revealed outstanding modifications in high Beta. MLP evinced significant changes in Theta brainwaves. Our study evidenced high Alpha modulation at the limbic lobe, implicating in a possible reduction of sympathetic system activation in the studied sample. Our main results on eLORETA suggest a strong increase in the current distribution, mostly in Alpha 2, at the Anterior Cingulate, which is related to the monitoring of mistakes regarding social conduct, recognition and expression of emotions. We also found that MLPs are able of evincing the main differences with high separability in Delta and Theta. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Comments on an article by Martin G. Frasch et al. (see record 2018-27622-001). Frasch et al. clearly shows the importance of prenatal challenges and mechanisms in determining an individual’s fetal, neonatal and later life health. The authors note that there is strong evidence that autonomic activity is a key component and marker of the potential for prenatal stress to induce programming of brain structure and function. The authors propose systems for monitoring the brain in development that will yield an improved understanding of potential markers for immediate and later life outcomes. Development of the autonomic nervous system has been well studied in fetal sheep. The sheep is the only species in which it is possible to conduct long-term collection of the measures of activity of the brain, heart and skeletal muscle in both mother and fetus from as early as midgestation through to the end of pregnancy. It is good to see this comprehensive review of the fetal sheep literature because this valuable experimental animal model is becoming less available for study each year due to the lack of the special facilities required and ever-increasing cost. The approaches used and the various features of fetal heart rate variability are excellently and comprehensively detailed. The authors propose that the next step in our understanding will undoubtedly see the introduction of machine learning tools which will enable integration of a variety of very different types of data such as DNA methylation, the metabolome, the microbiome and the autonomic nervous system that are described in the review.

N2  - The True Colours remote mood monitoring system was developed over a decade ago by researchers, psychiatrists, and software engineers at the University of Oxford to allow patients to report on a range of symptoms via text messages, Web interfaces, or mobile phone apps. The system has evolved to encompass a wide range of measures, including psychiatric symptoms, quality of life, and medication. Patients are prompted to provide data according to an agreed personal schedule: weekly, daily, or at specific times during the day. The system has been applied across a number of different populations, for the reporting of mood, anxiety, substance use, eating and personality disorders, psychosis, self-harm, and inflammatory bowel disease, and it has shown good compliance. Over the past decade, there have been over 36,000 registered True Colours patients and participants in the United Kingdom, with more than 20 deployments of the system supporting clinical service and research delivery. The system has been adopted for routine clinical care in mental health services, supporting more than 3000 adult patients in secondary care, and 27,263 adolescent patients are currently registered within Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire. The system has also proven to be an invaluable scientific resource as a platform for research into mood instability and as an electronic outcome measure in randomized controlled trials. This paper aimed to report on the existing applications of the system, setting out lessons learned, and to discuss the implications for tailored symptom monitoring, as well as the barriers to implementation at a larger scale.

N2  - Osteoporotic fractures in men are an increasing public health problem. Male osteoporosis is often a low-prioritized issue, however. To examine men’s experiences with osteoporosis and how they handle osteoporosis in their everyday lives, the authors collected data from four focus groups with a total of 16 men aged 51 to 82 years diagnosed with osteoporosis. Critical psychology was used as a theoretical framework for the data analysis, which aimed to elicit information about the men’s daily lives. The men handled osteoporosis in different ways using different strategies. The authors found patterns that resonated with the social construction of hegemonic masculinity as displayed through the men’s fear of weakness and endurance through physical activity, as well as identity construction through active decision making in relation to health. Understanding and implementation of these issues is necessary in the development of preventive, screening, and monitoring strategies, as well as in the clinical care of men with osteoporosis.

N2  - Accidents in high stake fields such as the nuclear industry are often associated with degradation in human performance resulting in errors on a variety of perceptual and decision making tasks (Reason, 2000). Although there is human performance research available in related domains such as aviation and military defense, there is also a need for empirical human performance data from the nuclear domain (Elks et al., 2012). This dissertation sought to understand the relationship among individual differences in working memory and spatial ability, perceived workload and stress, and the types of tasks found in a nuclear power plant (NPP) main control room (MCR) environment. The dissertation was conducted in two phases. Study 1 consisted of an experiment investigating the relative contributions of working memory (verbal and spatial) and spatial ability to the performance of tasks relating to monitoring and detection, situation awareness, and pattern recognition, their impact on subjective workload and stress, and the impact of an auditory alarm on these relationships. Study 2 consisted of an archival data analysis investigating the role of working memory (verbal only) and spatial ability, in the performance of tasks relating to monitoring and detection and response implementation using two basic and isolated control room tasks that were performed on a digital representation of an analog NPP simulator. The findings of this research suggest that spatial processing in the form of spatial working memory and spatial visualization plays a central role in the performance of all tasks investigated with the exception of the Response Implementation task, which apparently lacked adequate task complexity. In contrast, with the exception of the Detection task in Study 2, which involved a verbal component via the manipulation of numerical information, verbal working memory was not found to play a central role in the performance of the tasks examined. The dissociation of the effect of the verbal working memory component in the Probability Monitoring and Detection tasks reveals how task structure can impact the kinds of demands placed on an operator even in similarly categorized vigilance tasks. Nonetheless, verbal working memory did have an influence on perceived workload and stress. In light of comparable task performance, workload and stress measures appear to be more sensitive to individual differences in verbal working memory than performance measures alone. Additionally, in relation to the relationship of workload as a function of individual differences in working memory and spatial ability, sensitivity of the various assessments employed may vary as a function of task complexity.

N2  - Tracking symptoms progression in the early stages of Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a laborious endeavor as the disease can be expressed with vastly different phenotypes, forcing clinicians to follow a multi-parametric approach in patient evaluation, looking for not only motor symptomatology but also non-motor complications, including cognitive decline, sleep problems and mood disturbances. Being neurodegenerative in nature, PD is expected to inflict a continuous degradation in patients’ condition over time. The rate of symptoms progression, however, is found to be even more chaotic than the vastly different phenotypes that can be expressed in the initial stages of PD. In this work, an analysis of baseline PD characteristics is performed using machine learning techniques, to identify prognostic factors for early rapid progression of PD symptoms. Using open data from the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) study, an extensive set of baseline patient evaluation outcomes is examined to isolate determinants of rapid progression within the first two and four years of PD. The rate of symptoms progression is estimated by tracking the change of the Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS‐UPDRS) total score over the corresponding follow-up period. Patients are ranked according to their progression rates and those who expressed the highest rates of MDS-UPDRS total score increase per year of follow-up period are assigned into the rapid progression class, using 5- and 10-quantiles partition. Classification performance against the rapid progression class was evaluated in a per quantile partition analysis scheme and in quantile-independent approach, respectively. The results shown a more accurate patient discrimination with quantile partitioning, however, a much more compact subset of baseline factors is extracted in the latter, making a more suitable for actual interventions in practice. Classification accuracy improved in all cases when using the longer 4-year follow-up period to estimate PD progression, suggesting that a prolonged patient evaluation can provide better outcomes in identifying rapid progression phenotype. Non-motor symptoms are found to be the main determinants of rapid symptoms progression in both follow-up periods, with autonomic dysfunction, mood impairment, anxiety, REM sleep behavior disorders, cognitive decline and memory impairment being alarming signs at baseline evaluation, along with rigidity symptoms, certain laboratory blood test results and genetic mutations.

N2  - Affordable measurement of core body temperature (Tc) in a continuous, real-time fashion is now possible. With this advance comes a new data analysis paradigm for occupational epidemiology. We characterize issues arising after obtaining Tc data over 188 workdays for 83 participating farmworkers, a population vulnerable to effects of rising temperatures due to climate change. We describe a novel approach to these data using smoothing and functional data analysis. This approach highlights different data aspects compared with describing Tc at a single time point or summaries of the time course into an indicator function (e.g., did Tc ever exceed 38 °C, the threshold limit value for occupational heat exposure). Participants working in ferneries had significantly higher Tc at some point during the workday compared with those working in nurseries, despite a shorter workday for fernery participants. Our results typify the challenges and opportunities in analyzing Big Data streams from real-time physiologic monitoring. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Mental state monitoring is a critical component of current and future human-machine interfaces, including semi-autonomous driving and flying, air traffic control, decision aids, training systems, and will soon be integrated into ubiquitous products like cell phones and laptops. Current mental state assessment approaches supply quantitative measures, but their only frame of reference is generic population-level ranges. What is needed are physiological biometrics that are validated in the context of task performance of individuals. Using curated intake experiments, we are able to generate personalized models of three key biometrics as useful indicators of mental state; namely, mental fatigue, stress, and attention. We demonstrate improvements to existing approaches through the introduction of new features. Furthermore, addressing the current limitations in assessing the efficacy of biometrics for individual subjects, we propose and employ a multi-level validation scheme for the biometric models by means of k-fold cross-validation for discrete classification and regression testing for continuous prediction. The paper not only provides a unified pipeline for extracting a comprehensive mental state evaluation from a parsimonious set of sensors (only EEG and ECG), but also demonstrates the use of validation techniques in the absence of empirical data. Furthermore, as an example of the application of these models to novel situations, we evaluate the significance of correlations of personalized biometrics to the dynamic fluctuations of accuracy and reaction time on an unrelated threat detection task using a permutation test. Our results provide a path toward integrating biometrics into augmented human-machine interfaces in a judicious way that can help to maximize task performance.

N2  - The topic of stress is nowadays a very important one, not only in research but on social life in general. People are increasingly aware of this problem and its consequences at several levels: health, social life, work, quality of life, etc. This resulted in a significant increase in the search for devices and applications to measure and manage stress in real-time. Recent technological and scientific evolution fosters this interest with the development of new methods and approaches. In this paper we survey these new methods for stress assessment, focusing especially on those that are suited for the workplace: one of today’s major sources of stress. We contrast them with more traditional methods and compare them between themselves, evaluating nine characteristics. Given the diversity of methods that exist nowadays, this work facilitates the stakeholders’ decision towards which one to use, based on how much their organization values aspects such as privacy, accuracy, cost-effectiveness or intrusiveness.

N2  - Functional neuroimaging of the human amygdala has been of great interest to uncover the neural underpinnings of emotions, mood, motivation, social cognition, and decision making, as well as their dysfunction in psychiatric disorders. Yet, several factors limit in vivo imaging of amygdalar function, most importantly its location deep within the temporal lobe adjacent to air-filled cavities that cause magnetic field inhomogeneities entailing signal dropouts. Additionally, the amygdala and the extended amygdalar region consist of several substructures, which have been assigned different functions and have important implications for functional and effective connectivity studies. Here we show that high-resolution ultra-high field fMRI at 7 T can be used to overcome these fundamental challenges for acquisition and can meet some of the demands posed by the complex neuroanatomy and -physiology in this region. Utilizing the inherently high SNR, we use an optimized preprocessing and data analysis strategy to demonstrate that imaging of the (extended) amygdala is highly reliable and robust. Using unsmoothed single-subject data allowed us to differentiate brain activation during processing of emotional faces in the central and basolateral amygdala and, for the first time, in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), which is critically involved in the neural mechanisms of anxiety and threat monitoring. We also provide a quantitative assessment of single subject sensitivity, which is relevant for connectivity studies that rely on time course extraction of functionally-defined volumes of interest.

N2  - Background: Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) impacts quality of life (QoL). Psychological factors influence the course of the disease and should be targeted for intervention. Methods: Our study was a prospective, randomised control trial. Fifty-six outpatients were randomly chosen and allocated to a treatment group or a waiting-list control group. Treatment group patients attended three relaxation-training sessions and received an audio disc for home practice. Evaluations performed pre and post-treatment: state anxiety was assessed with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, QoL with the IBD Questionnaire. The Visual Analogue Scale assessed pain, depression, stress and mood. Patients completed a symptom monitoring diary. The control group's symptoms were monitored without study-related treatment. Results: Thirty-nine subjects completed the study and were included in the data analysis. Following the relaxation-training intervention, the treatment group's (n = 18) measured results showed a statistically significant improvement as compared to the control group (n = 21) (time by treatment interaction): anxiety levels decreased (p p p < 0.01). Conclusions: Findings indicate IBD patients may benefit from relaxation training in their holistic care. New studies as well as further investigation of the subject are warranted.

N2  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to describe the experiences of Native American nurses working in their tribal communities to address retention. Design: An interpretive phenomenological study guided by a Native American research agenda and a Native American nursing practice model. Methods: In-depth interviews with nine Native American nurses were conducted. Data analysis used interpretive phenomenological procedures including an iterative process with Native American consultants and researchers to develop themes. Conclusions: Native American nurses experienced a great deal of stress and illness as they attempted to fulfill their mission to help their people. The three themes were: (a) paying the price to fulfill my mission, (b) being and connecting holistically, and (c) transcending the system. Recommendations include strategies for nurse educators, tracking the ethnicity of nurses in each Indian Health Service area, documenting their reasons for leaving, and conducting further research to develop community-based interventions to improve retention.

N2  - There is a notable overlap and co-occurrence of mental health and learning challenges in adolescence. Existing research highlights associations between learning disabilities and mental health problems; however, limited research explores additional variables, such as familial influences. Using a developmental relational systems framework, this research advances understandings of the influences of positive parenting on adolescents with learning disabilities. Secondary data analysis of the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth was used to explore direct and indirect effects of parental depression, family functioning, parental nurturing and monitoring behaviours, adolescent social and emotional competencies on adolescent mental health. Adolescent social and emotional competencies and parental monitoring were strong significant mediators in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression among youth with learning disabilities. Theoretical and practical implications related to ecological resilience and positive parenting are explored. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Social anxiety is a negative emotion which may impair the health of the heart and social functioning of an individual. This work analyzes the influence of social anxiety on the autonomic nerve control of the heart in two social exposure events: public speaking and thesis defending. In an experiment of public speaking, 59 human subjects were tested, and 11 conventional heartbeat measures and a heartbeat measure named the range of local Hurst exponents (RLHE) were evaluated for their capabilities to reveal the onset of social anxiety. Two-sample t-test between the baseline data and high anxiety data shows that social anxiety significantly reduces the complexity of the heartbeats. In an experiment of thesis defense, heartbeats data were acquired from nine graduate students. With the combination of three conventional features and the RLHE feature, a support vector machine classifier obtained true positive rate and true negative rate of 84.88 and 97.29 percent in the five-fold cross validation process of binary classification between high anxiety status and low anxiety status; the classifier also realized a generalization accuracy of 81.82 percent in detecting the high anxiety status in the thesis defense. A real-time anxiety monitoring system was established based on the above anxiety detecting method. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - The purpose of this qualitative single-case study was to develop an understanding of how mindfulness instruction strategies are being used in K-12 classrooms in Arizona, particularly as academic intervention. Recent literature discussing the use of mindfulness instruction in schools reveals psychological, behavioral, social, and physical benefits for children and adolescents, but the measured effects of mindfulness instruction as an academic intervention are inconsistent, ranging from negligible to noteworthy. The Monitoring and Acceptance Theory from Lindsay and Creswell (2017) provide the theoretical foundation for the present study. Focusing on school-based mindfulness instruction, the present study investigated how a sample of K-12 teachers who have been trained in the use mindfulness instruction strategies incorporate those strategies in their classrooms, particularly as academic intervention. The sources of data included semi-structured interviews, a focus group discussion, and field observation notes. Data analysis procedures included transcription, data cleaning, and a multi-step framework analysis. Key themes extracted from data analysis covered frequency of use, duration of use, in-classroom strategies, home practice strategies, schoolwide strategies, considerations for use, experiences, and student responses. Participants described how mindfulness affects student learning by eliminating stress, improving focus and engagement, and heightening metacognition. In addition to listing the indirect effects of mindfulness instruction strategies on academic success (such as by improving student behaviors), participants described direct positive effects on academic performance.

N2  - While the effects of September 11th, 2001 have been heavily studied, effects of the Anthrax attacks that directly followed has not been a widespread focus of research. This set of events, however, may be more representative of terrorism as it exists across the world, and there is both theoretical and empirical evidence indicating that responses to the Anthrax attacks may be worse than to 9/11. The following secondary data analysis was conducted to identify factors that predict adjustment to the Anthrax attacks among individuals with only vicarious exposure. Based on available empirical and theoretical data, it was hypothesized that individual level of perceived threat from anthrax as well as mental and behavioral adjustment outcomes would all be predicted by initial reactions to the Anthrax attacks. Initial reactions tested included individual perceptions of who was to blame for 9/11 and the Anthrax attacks, whether or not something could have been done to prevent them, amount of worry about exposure to anthrax through the mail, amount of threat perceived from 9/11 as it relates to anthrax threat, and amount of exposure to media coverage of 9/11 and the Anthrax attacks. Mental health outcomes of adjustment included individual perceived stress, symptoms of posttraumatic stress, positive and negative change in outlook, worrying about themselves, and worrying about others. Behavioral outcomes of adjustment included level of perceived safety in entering government or office buildings in the wake of the Anthrax attacks, as well as amount of change in monitoring for illness symptoms. It was hypothesized that initial reactions to the Anthrax attacks would predict perceived threat, mental, and behavioral outcomes of adjustment, Furthermore, threat was expected mediate reactions to the Anthrax attacks and adjustment outcomes, while mental health outcomes were also expected to mediate the relationship between initial reactions and behavior outcomes of adjustment. Questionnaires were mailed out 2-3 months after the initial Anthrax attacks, and again 8 months after. Participants completed the questionnaires and mailed them back to the researchers. Linear mixed models were employed to test the hypotheses while not excluding data for participants that returned only the first questionnaire. Initial reactions predicted perceived anthrax threat and adjustment outcomes. More worry about mail exposure to anthrax and more threat from 9/11 predicted perceived anthrax threat, perceived stress, posttraumatic stress, negative outlook change, worry about themselves, perceived safety, and illness monitoring. Furthermore, perceived threat mediated these relationships. Posttraumatic stress symptomatology also predicted more perceived safety, and posttraumatic stress mediated the relationships between 9/11 and anthrax threat on perceived safety. Overall, perceived anthrax threat was a powerful indicator of mental and behavioral adjustment outcomes and should be an area of initial assessment to determine individuals at risk for more chronic symptomatology. These results were discussed within the context of why the Anthrax attacks were related to 9/11 but nevertheless produced different effects. Alternative ideas were presented which may help explain some unexpected findings. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Daily experience of pain can lead to long-term disability, particularly for individuals with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). Inheritance of this genetic disorder leads to changes in hemoglobin causing the stiffening and distorting of red blood cells into the shape of "sickles". As a result, patients experience both chronic and acute pain caused by this sickling that restricts blood flow to different parts of their bodies. The experience of sickle cell pain has been found to be extremely variable within and across patients with respect to location, frequency, severity, age and co-morbidities; each patient is truly unique when it comes to the presentation of pain, making it difficult to define a consistent pain management procedure. Current developments in mobile technology provide new tools for understanding and managing SCD pain outside the clinical setting, where characteristics of pain can be captured using self-report measures administered using mobile applications on patients' smart phones. Mobile sensor technology also allows for the continuous monitoring of physiological measures including heart rate variability, arousal, temperature, and movement. The current project aimed to assess patterns of changes in these physiological measures across different pain intensities, in order to identify if these measures can serve as indicators of pain intensity or the onset of severe pain events in patients with SCD. Four young-adult patients with SCD were recruited from Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC). The sample included two males, two females, all 20 yrs. old and African Americans. Patients wore the Empatica E4 wristband for four consecutive days which tracked their movement, blood volume pulse (BPV), heart rate (HR), electrodermal activity (EDA), movement, and skin temperature (ST). They also used the Catch My Pain mobile application to track their pain location, pain intensity, pain descriptors, happiness, stress and fatigue. Regression and machine learning analyses were employed to test the hypothesis that the physiological measures captured by the Empatica could predict changes in the patients' reported levels of pain intensity across different periods of the day. Linear regression analyses revealed different combinations of significant predictors for each individual patient; these included the average and standard deviation of heart rate, the average maxline and recurrence of skin temperature, average maxline of skin conductance, and average value of blood volume pulse. For the machine learning, three different classification algorithms Linear Regression, Multi-layer Perceptron and Random Forrest significantly predicted pain severity in two of the four patients. In conclusion, the current study demonstrates the potential to detect pain severity through the examination of patterns of changes in physiological signals including heart rate and skin conductance. It provides new insights into the nature of pain experience as unique to each individual patient, and reveals significant potential in developing pain management interventions that are mindful and adaptive to the individual needs and experiences of patients with SCD.

N2  - The New York State Veterans Administration Hospital System has sought to improve the quality and efficiency of health care delivery to veterans presenting with mental health diagnosis including post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and substance abuse through the use of a telehealth monitoring system called The Care Coordination/Home Telehealth (CCHT) Program. A retrospective static group comparison designed to look at the utility of the CCHT service to reduce recidivism was conducted within a northeast Department of Veterans Affairs health care hospital system over a 6-month timeframe. Recidivism was defined as emergency room visits and inpatient admissions. Data analysis examined the effect of telehealth CCHT interventions on overall recidivism and recidivism in subgroups of PTSD, depression, and substance abuse. A supplemental analysis examined links between CCHT module use and contact calls with recidivism among program participants. Results showed that CCHT participants had a significantly lower recidivism rate than non-participants when defined as emergency utilization but not as admissions. Also those CCHT participants who presented to the emergency room used the CCHT module more than those that did not, and no statistically significant difference in the number of calls between the two groups was found.

N2  - Objective To better understand Black and White mothers' qualitative reactions to their adolescents' hospitalizations due to suicide attempts. Background Caregivers of youth with suicidal behaviors play a vital role in youth's subsequent treatment and recovery. Yet little attention has been paid to how they are affected by youth's psychiatric hospitalizations or how their reactions may be influenced by race. Method Twenty Black mothers (Mage = 42.50; SD = 8.48) and 20 White mothers (Mage = 44.85; SD = 6.86) were randomly selected from data originally collected for a larger longitudinal, mixed method, multisite study. Data analysis was informed by grounded theory methodology. Results Four themes emerged from the data: mothers' emotional distress; mothers' coping, needs, and supports; mothers' perceived need for increased monitoring; and improved mother–child relationships. Conclusions Black mothers and White mothers largely had similar reactions to youth's hospitalizations; however, nuanced differences also were noted regarding how they described their experiences and what they emphasized. Implications During discharge planning, mothers need additional support (beyond referrals) in their roles as caregivers and for their own coping. Additional clinical and research implications are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - This paper provides a brief survey of recent developments on the use of electroencephalogram (EEG) sensors for detecting mental fatigue (MF) in human operators during tasks involving human–machine interaction. This research topic has received much attention since there is a consensus among experts on the increasing relation between human failure and accidents in safety-critical tasks. MF is one of the most influential aspects leading to human failure and the most reliable way to assess it is using operator’s physiological data, especially EEG. In the past few decades, hundreds of publications have explored the use of EEG alone or together with other objective and subjective measures for assessing MF, drowsiness, and tiredness in human operators. With recent improvements in data preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification algorithms, the monitoring and mitigation of MF in real time has become a reality. This trend is mainly due to the increasing use of machine learning techniques. This paper provides a comprehensive look at the current state of the art in the field of MF detection using EEG, identifying the currently used technique, algorithms, and methods and possible trends and promising areas for further research. The paper is concluded by suggesting a kernel partial least squares discrete-output linear regression based model as an all-around good option for an MF assessment system.

N2  - Background: Smartphones provide a low-cost and efficient means to collect population level data. Several small studies have shown promise in predicting mood variability from smartphone-based sensor and usage data, but have not been generalized to nationally recruited samples. This study used passive smartphone data, demographic characteristics, and baseline depressive symptoms to predict prospective daily mood. Method: Daily phone usage data were collected passively from 271 Android phone users participating in a fully remote randomized controlled trial of depression treatment (BRIGHTEN). Participants completed daily Patient Health Questionnaire-2. A machine learning approach was used to predict daily mood for the entire sample and individual participants. Results: Sample-wide estimates showed a marginally significant association between physical mobility and self-reported daily mood (B = –0.04, P R² ∼ 0). Focusing on individuals, 13.9% of participants showed significant association (FDR 0.50) for 80.6% of participants and very strong prediction in a subset (median AUC >0.80) for 11.8% of participants. Conclusions: Passive smartphone data with current features may not be suited for predicting daily mood at a population level because of the high degree of intra- and interindividual variation in phone usage patterns and daily mood ratings. Personalized models show encouraging early signs for predicting an individual's mood state changes, with GPS-derived mobility being the top most important feature in the present sample.

N2  - Background: Persistent somatic symptoms are associated with psychological distress, impaired function, and medical help-seeking behavior. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-15 is used as a screening instrument for somatization and as a monitoring instrument for somatic symptom severity. A bifactorial model has been described, with one general factor and four orthogonal specific symptom factors. The objective of the present study was to assess and to clarify the factor structure of the PHQ-15 within and between different countries in Western Europe and China. Method: Cross-sectional secondary data analysis performed in three patient data samples from two Western European countries (Germany N = 2,517, the Netherlands N = 456) and from China (N = 1,329). Confirmatory factor analyses (CFA), and structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis were performed. Results: The general factor is found in every sample. However, although the outcomes of the PHQ-15 estimate severity of somatic symptoms in different facets, these subscales may have different meanings in the European and Chinese setting. Replication of the factorial structure was possible in the German and Dutch datasets but not in the dataset from China. For the Chinese dataset, a bifactorial model with a different structure for the cardiopulmonary factor is suggested. The PHQ-15 could discern somatization from anxiety and depression within the three samples. Conclusion: The PHQ-15 is a valid questionnaire that can discern somatization from anxiety and depression within different cultures like Europe or China. It can be fitted to a bifactorial model for categorical data, however, the model can only be recommended for use of the general factor. Application of the orthogonal subscales in non-European samples is not corroborated by the results. The differences cannot be ascribed to differences in health care settings or by differences in concomitant depression or anxiety but instead, a cultural factor involving concepts of disease may play a role in this as they may play a role in the translation of the questionnaire. Further research is needed to explore this, and replication studies are needed regarding the factorial structure of the PHQ-15 in China. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Today, the Internet of Things (IoT) in therapeutic administrations has ended up being more productive in light of the fact that the correspondence among authorities and patients has been improved with versatile applications. These applications are made by the associations with the objective that the pros can screen the patient’s prosperity. If any issue has hopped out at the patient, by then the authority approaches the patient and gives the correct treatment. In this proposition, particular focus is given to infant human administrations, in light of the fact that the greatest fear of gatekeepers is that they would lose their infant kids at whatever point. Therefore, in this part, a business contraption has been recognized which screens the consistent information about the infant’s heart rate, oxygen levels, and resting position. In case anything happens to the tyke, the information will get to the adaptable application, which has been made by an association and is mechanically available by finishing a representation field test for the kid; the information is recorded and examined.

N2  - The research refers to a pilot project set up at the SPTM of Vicenza aimed at monitoring the outcome of abused minors. The work is based on the theoretical model of Complex Trauma. The adolescents from the examined sample have suffered continuous maltreatment conditions and traumatic experiences; they did benefit from a protection and support program for at least one year. Participants have been assigned to two groups according to the criteria for the diagnosis of Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Each group has been analyzed on variables related to risk factors, to protective factors, to institutional response factors (care system and judicial system). Data analysis shows participants’ personal resources to be the most incisive protective factors; continuous, long duration and family-involvement interventions have been proven the most effective ones.

N2  - Problem Statement: Enormous increase over the last decade in the number of digital and medical procedural devices (DMPT) dictates school nurses' increasing responsibility to understand all computer systems and their application for correct use in daily nursing practice.Purpose: A quantitative and qualitative study to address a research gap on the impact of workload, DMPT and educational resources on technostress in the New Jersey (NJ) School Nurse. Queried: Is the school nurse's scope of practice and workload affected by DMPT? How do school nurses master competency of DMPT and educational resources? How do school nurses describe their use of DMPT?Methodology: A quantitative cross-sectional and qualitative survey of 190 School Nurses in 691 NJ school districts.Data Collection: Purposive re-mail recruitment through the NJSSNA, NJAAP and the NJSNA, with the assistance of the NJ Superintendents of Schools. Electronic data collection on school nurses' roles and uses of electronic health and educational resource procedures, wireless medical monitoring devices and programs in their school nursing practice. Completion of a 53-item, four-section questionnaire: 1) Demographics (17 questions); 2) Educational Resources (6 questions); 3) Revised Technostress Questionnaire (Tarafdar, et al, 2010;Wang et al. 2008) (29 questions); 3) Qualitative description of experience using DMPT developed by this researcher (1 question).Data Analysis: IBM SPSS version 25 (2019) tested relationships between and predictive effects of workload, educational resources and contemporary DMPT on technostress. Descriptive statistics, correlation, a series of bivariate tests, and multiple regression tested all explanatory variables (i.e., the covariates and independent variables) and their impact on technostress creators, technostress inhibitors, educational resources and DMPT at a level of significance (p<.05). Qualitative data was content analyzed for codes and categories, then subjected to quantitative data analysis using descriptive statistics to further test for predictive effects.Findings: Of 6 hypotheses tested, 4 were supported, 1 partially supported, and 1 not supported. QDA revealed DMPT Increases Workload/Stress (M=2.68, SD=.46), t (113) =2.84, p<.01 evidenced by significantly higher Technostress scores (M=2.96, SD=.48) relative to those that reported that DMPT Did Not Increase Workload/Stress.Implications: Increasing technology and DPMT use contributes to Technostress. Nursing curricula and workforce education need to address it. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Maternal psychosocial factors contribute to adverse pregnancy outcome, but very few studies have assessed associations of duration and experiences of stress, depression, and intimate partner violence (IPV) with maternal and newborn outcomes. Objectives: It was hypothesized that duration and level of maternal stress, depression, and IPV would predict increased risk of adverse maternal/newborn outcomes. Methods: A secondary data analysis of a population-based data set collected by the Utah Department of Health Pregnancy Risk Assessment and Monitoring System and birth certificates for 4682 live births was conducted, reflecting a total population size of 143,373 live births in 2009–2011. Exposures of interest were experiences and duration of maternal stress, depression, and IPV before and during pregnancy. Outcomes were gestational age, birth weight, newborn admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), and postpartum depression (PPD) symptoms and diagnosis. Results: After controlling for maternal demographics, body mass index, and smoking, women with greater duration of depression before and during pregnancy showed an increase in admission of their newborn to NICU (adjusted odds ratios [aORs] = 1.66–2.48, p ORs = 3.94–9.13, p ORs = 7.72–59.60, p ORs = 1.34–5.51, p < .001), but not PPD diagnosis or NICU admissions. Discussion: Longer lasting maternal depression and stress are associated with poorer outcomes for mothers and newborns. Future prospective studies should evaluate the usefulness of preconception and continuous prenatal risk identification of maternal depression and stress. This would facilitate timely psychosocial interventions as an approach to improving maternal/newborn outcomes for these higher risk women. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Reports an error in "Wild facial expression recognition based on incremental active learning" by Minhaz Uddin Ahmed, Kim Jin Woo, Kim Yeong Hyeon, Md. Rezaul Bashar and Phill Kyu Rhee (Cognitive Systems Research, 2018[Dec], Vol 52, 212-222). One original Table published in the paper were incorrect. The correct table is given in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2019-05147-021). Facial expression recognition in a wild situation is a challenging problem in computer vision research due to different circumstances, such as pose dissimilarity, age, lighting conditions, occlusions, etc. Numerous methods, such as point tracking, piecewise affine transformation, compact Euclidean space, modified local directional pattern, and dictionary-based component separation have been applied to solve this problem. In this paper, we have proposed a deep learning–based automatic wild facial expression recognition system where we have implemented an incremental active learning framework using the VGG16 model developed by the Visual Geometry Group. We have gathered a large amount of unlabeled facial expression data from Intelligent Technology Lab (ITLab) members at Inha University, Republic of Korea, to train our incremental active learning framework. We have collected these data under five different lighting conditions: good lighting, average lighting, close to the camera, far from the camera, and natural lighting and with seven facial expressions: happy, disgusted, sad, angry, surprised, fear, and neutral. Our facial recognition framework has been adapted from a multi-task cascaded convolutional network detector. Repeating the entire process helps obtain better performance. Our experimental results have demonstrated that incremental active learning improves the starting baseline accuracy from 63% to average 88% on ITLab dataset on wild environment. We also present extensive results on face expression benchmark such as Extended Cohn-Kanade Dataset, as well as ITLab face dataset captured in wild environment and obtained better performance than state-of-the-art approaches.

N2  - Aim and objectives: To generate a descriptive theoretical framework about the experiences of women who discontinued hormone replacement therapy. Background: Some menopausal women would depend on hormone replacement therapy for relieving their menopausal symptoms. However, most of them feared of hormone replacement therapy's side effects and tried to discontinue hormone replacement therapy immediately. How did these women self‐manage their discomforts without using dependent medicine—hormone replacement therapy? There are few studies conducted on this issue. Design: A grounded theory research was applied. Methods: Nineteen Taiwanese women discontinuing hormone replacement therapy for three months, aged 45 to 67 years, participated in face‐to‐face audio‐taped interviews. Data collection, and coding of interviews, and data analysis occurred simultaneously. All conversations were audio‐recorded and then transcribed as verbatim text. The constant comparative method was used to analyse the interview data. Results: ‘Relieving my discomforts safely’ was the core theme for describing and guiding the process of discontinuing hormone replacement therapy. ‘Immediately discontinuing hormone replacement therapy—it would hurt my body’ was identified as the antecedent condition. Analyses showed five dimensions to the women's relieving my discomforts safely: (1) symptoms bothered me again, (2) negative emotions, (3) learning to let it go, (4) trying to use nonhormone replacement therapy or products and (5) choosing safely therapies as first priority. Finally, some women would choose their suitable nonhormone replacement therapy way, and some women would reuse hormone replacement therapy cautiously. Conclusions: ‘Relieving my discomforts safely’ was the first‐priority consideration for the menopausal women discontinuing hormone replacement therapy. It is the challenge to establish the health programme or management for helping these women felt safety and security to relieve their menopausal symptoms by using hormone replacement therapy or nonhormone replacement therapy. Relevance to clinical practice: Healthcare providers need to empower women the rights of decision‐making of using hormone replacement therapy and assist them in monitoring their health status to reduce their fear and uncertainty.

N2  - The purpose of this sequential mixed method study was to determine if there were differences between central office administrators', school administrators', and bilingual and English as a second language (ESL) teachers' overall and levels of action, self-regulation, and means efficacies, when controlling for years of experience with bilingual and ESL classrooms and hours of training on the English language proficiency standards (ELPS) and the Texas English Language Proficiency Assessment System (TELPAS) training and their schools' TELPAS composite scores. Additionally, the study focused on the leaders' perceptions about the implementation of the ELPS and TELPAS in their bilingual and ESL classrooms. In the explanatory sequential mixed method design, the quantitative data collection phase included the data survey analysis from a purposeful sample of 150 leaders in a large urban school district in Texas. The qualitative phase involved data analysis from face-to-face interviews from a purposeful sample of 24 leaders. Results indicated that there were significant differences among the leaders' overall efficacies and the leaders' different efficacies: action, means, and self-regulation when controlling for leaders' hours of ELPS training, but not when controlling for years of experience. Leaders' perceptions on the ELPS and TELPAS professional development revealed the importance of the ELPS and TELPAS trainings as support for teachers and students; value of integrating and implementing trainings; the positives of revisiting ELPS training; the value of professional learning communities; TELPAS isolation; and positive district support. The ELPS and TELPAS, professional learning communities, district systems, and objectivity of rating with the new online TELPAS tests were positives. Areas for growth included developing teachers' knowledge on the ELPS, need for school administrators' instructional leadership; their advocacy for ELPS and TELPAS; need for differentiated instruction; the need for more objective rating with TELPAS; the logistics and format of the new TELPAS online testing; and teachers' fear and stress with TELPAS. Recommendations included long-range strategic planning; the implementation of a two-way dual language program model; hiring for ELPS and TELPAS school instructional leadership; implementation of shared learning goals and linguistically accommodated instruction as part of a viable curriculum; professional development with systemic follow-up and coaching of teachers; monitoring of goals through the English language learners' talks, portfolio-based assessment, and instructional rounds.

N2  - Objectives: This prospective cohort study examines the clinical effectiveness of electronic medical record clinical decision support (EMR CDS) for opioid prescribing. Methods: Data analysis included primary care patients with chronic opioid therapy for noncancer pain seen within an integrated health delivery system in Louisiana between January 2017 and October 2018. EMR CDS incorporated an opioid health maintenance tool to display the status of risk mitigation, and the medication order embedded the morphine equivalent daily dose (MEDD) calculator and a hyperlink to the Louisiana pharmacy drug monitoring program. Outcome measures included change in the average MEDD and rates of opioid risk mitigation, hospitalization, and emergency department use. Results: Among 14 221 patients, 9% had prescriptions with an average MEDD ≥ 90 mg. There were no significant changes in MEDD after EMR CDS implementation. Increasing age, Charlson Comorbidity Index score, female sex, black non-Hispanic race, non-opioid pain medication co-prescriptions, and specialty referrals were associated with a lower odds of MEDD ≥ 90 (high-dose threshold). Medicare or self-pay, substance abuse history, and pain agreements were associated with increased odds of prescribing above this high-dose threshold. After incorporation of EMR CDS, patients had higher rates of urine drug screens (17% vs 7%) and naloxone prescriptions (3% vs 1%, all P < .001). In addition, specialty referrals to physical or occupational therapy, orthopedics, neurology, and psychiatry or psychology increased in the postintervention period. Although emergency department use decreased (rate ratio 0.92; 95% confidence interval 0.89-0.95), hospitalization rates did not change. Conclusions: EMR CDS improved adherence to opioid risk mitigation strategies. Further research examining which practice redesign interventions effectively reduce high-dose opioid prescribing is needed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Integrative and unobtrusive approaches to monitoring health and stress can assist in preventative medicine and disease management, and provide capabilities for complex work environments, such as military deployments and long-duration human space exploration missions. With many data streams that could potentially provide critical information about the health, behavior, and psychosocial states of individuals or small groups, the central question of this research is how to reliably measure health and stress states over time. This integrative approach to health and stress monitoring has implemented biological metabolite profiling, wearables data analysis, and survey assessment for comparing biological, behavioral, and psychological perspectives. Health monitoring technologies aim to provide objective data about health status. Providing objective information can help mitigate biases or blind spots in an individual's perception. Consider an individual who is unwilling to openly admit to psychosocial distress and unhealthy habits, or an individual who has habituated to long-term stressors and is unable to recognize a chronic state of high stress. Both honesty and self-awareness are required for accurate self-reporting. Digital health technologies, such as wearable devices, provide objective data for health monitoring. Compared to surveys, wearables are less influenced by participant openness, and compared to biological samples, wearables require less equipment and less labor for analysis. However, inherent to every data stream are limitations due to uncertainty and sensitivity. This research has been conducted in collaboration with Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation (HI-SEAS), which is a Mars analog research site on the slopes on Mauna Loa volcano in Hawaii. During 8-month and 12-month HI-SEAS missions in the 2014-2016 timeframe, twelve individuals provided hair and urine samples for metabolite profiling, utilized consumer-grade wearables to monitor sleep and activity behaviors, and responded to surveys for recording perceived health and stress levels. This work has developed a self-report instrument for stress characterization, efficient protocols for metabolite profiling, novel measures of sleep quality and activity levels, and has evaluated performance differences of JawboneRTM and FitbitRTM wearable devices that were worn in tandem. There is considerable debate about the accuracy of data collected from wearable devices. Therefore, the success of next-generation wearable devices is hinging on the ability to reliably process wearables data into meaningful health information. By simultaneously quantifying biological metabolites, sleep and activity behaviors, and psychological perceptions of health, this research is evaluating possible predictors of health and stress, such as evaluating if activity and sleep behaviors recorded by wearables can be predictive of biological metabolites and perceived health. This research has developed data-driven insights for advancing the next-generation of biological, behavioral, and psychological health monitoring capabilities.

N2  - The purpose of this grounded theory study was to explicate a substantive theory/model that describes the basic social processes (BSP) operating when a registered nurse (RN) re-enters the workplace following completion of substance use disorder (SUD) treatment. There are a reported 2.6 million RNs employed in the U.S (U.S. Department of Labor, 2014). Over the past 25 years, prevalence studies have found up to 10% of nurses will meet diagnostic criteria for SUD, similar to prevalence rates in the general population. SUDs among nurses present challenges to society and to the nursing profession. State boards of nursing operate primarily to protect the public but also work to preserve the careers of substance dependent nurses by encouraging SUD treatment and recovery. A majority of states now have in place alternative-to-discipline programs to assist nurses during SUD treatment and to provide monitoring afterwards. Little research has been done on work re-entry for nurses following SUD treatment; no qualitative studies have been done that explore work re-entry from the perspective and experiences of the nurse. The research questions of this study identified the experiences in actualizing workplace re-entry, including what processes helped and what processes hindered work re-entry. Symbolic interactionism and pragmatism provided the theoretical and philosophical foundation for the study. Twenty-two RN participants (4 males, 18 females) who had completed SUD treatment and had a work re-entry experience were interviewed. The audio-taped, transcribed interviews were analyzed using a constant comparative method using the grounded theory approach of Strauss and Corbin (1990, 1998). Open, axial, and theoretical coding led to the emergence of axial and theoretical models that described the processes of work re-entry for participants. Findings of the study explicate participant experiences from two perspectives: unsuccessful and successful work re-entry as two separate theoretical models emerged during data analysis. All study participants eventually experienced successful work re-entry. The core variable of the unsuccessful work re-entry theoretical model was "lacking self-redefinition" as a person with SUD, an internal process reinforced by stigma, shame and fear, and characterized by limited use of recovery strategies and reluctance to follow monitoring mandates or disclose SUD status. The core variable of the successful work re-entry theoretical model was "self-redefinition," defined by internalization and acceptance of self as a person and a nurse with a SUD. Properties of self-redefinition included altered (re-defined) definitions of perceptions, values, and priorities, responses to recovery processes, and professional relationships and processes. The findings of this study have implications for multiple aspects of nursing: regulation, education, and practice, as well as for SUD treatment facilities. Nurses are able to re-enter the nursing workplace successfully but are a unique group among the SUD population. There is a need for increased efforts by regulatory and professional nursing bodies and healthcare systems to explore ways to retain RNs in practice and preserve careers after SUD treatment completion by supporting work re-entry success.

N2  - This study investigated the relationship between awareness of stress—as a result of monitoring stress levels multiple times a day—and its impact on relapse to addiction. The sample included 17 participants enrolled in an outpatient drug rehabilitation clinic. Participants recorded their stress levels with their cell phones four times a day for a 3-week period. Three month post-participation relapse rates of individuals who voluntarily opted to participate in the study were compared to those who did not participate to determine whether participation in the study would confer differential success in the rehabilitation program. This study used a methodology similar to the Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA). Results of this study showed that participants were twice as likely to remain in treatment compared to nonparticipants. Data analysis showed that participants' actual moment-to-moment stress remained fairly constant, however, participants reported a decrease in the perception of their stress. Furthermore, participants reported that they found it useful to participate and 100% of the participants reported that they would use this form of data collection again. The results of this study mirror the results of a study conducted by this researcher with a non-clinical sample. Reporting one's stress 4 times a day might help participants to become more mindful of their experience, thus becoming more tolerant of their affective states over time. Using cell phones to record stress levels multiple times a day may be a highly cost effective way to increase mindfulness, awareness, self-control as well as social support, and might increase the likelihood of program completion. These results are consistent with the literature on mindfulness training, suggesting that mindfulness may disrupt the spiral of stress precipitated by alcohol relapse, and thus, enhance clinical outcomes in substance-abusing populations.

N2  - Social media surveillance is becoming more and more popular. However, current surveillance methods do not utilize well-respected surveys, which were established over many decades in domains outside of computer science. Also the evaluation of the previous social media surveillance is not sufficient, especially for surveillance of happiness on social media. These motivated us to develop a general computational methodology for translating a well-known survey into a social media surveillance strategy. Therefore, traditional surveys could be utilized to broaden social media surveillance. The methodology could bridge domains like psychology and social science with computer science. We use life satisfaction on social media as a case study to illustrate our survey-to-surveillance methodology. We start with a famous life satisfaction survey, expand the survey statements to generate templates. Then we use the templates to build queries in our information retrieval system to retrieve the social media posts which could be considered as valid responses to the original survey. Filters were utilized to boost the performance of the retrieval system of our surveillance method. To evaluate our surveillance method, we developed a novel method to build the gold standard dataset. Instead of evaluating all the data instances like the traditional way, we ask human workers to "find" as many of the positives as possible in the dataset, the rest are assumed to be negatives. We used the method to build the gold standard dataset for the life satisfaction case study. We also build three more gold standard datasets to further demonstrate the value of our method. Using the life satisfaction gold standard dataset, we show that performance of our surveillance method of life satisfaction outperforms other popular methods (lexicon and machine learning based methods) used by previous researchers. Using our surveillance method of life satisfaction on social media, we did a comprehensive analysis of life satisfaction expressions on Twitter. We not only show the time series, daily and weekly cycle of life satisfaction on social media, but also found the differences in characteristics for users with different life satisfaction expressions. These include psychosocial features such as anxiety, anger and depression. In addition, we present the geographic distribution of life satisfaction, including the life satisfaction across the U.S. and places around the world. This thesis is the first to systematically explore life satisfaction expressions over Twitter. This is done using computational methods that derive from an established survey on life satisfaction.

N2  - Aim: To examine Chinese mothers’ experience of caring for their hospitalized sick child. Background: Engaging the mother in providing care for a hospitalized sick child is considered one of the key elements for high-quality care in advanced paediatric nursing. There is evidence that a mother’s belief in her capacity to manage stressful situations could improve the nurse–parent relationship because they might play an important role in protecting mothers against heightened stress during crisis situation. Design: An interpretive phenomenological approach involving semi-structured interview and thematic analysis was used. Method: Fifteen interviews were conducted in Hong Kong, China from April 2009–January 2010, with 15 mothers caring for their hospitalized sick children with acute injury or illness. Crist and Tanner’s circular process of hermeneutic interpretive phenomenology was chosen to guide the data analysis. Findings: The prevailing concept identified through analysis was the ‘constant vigilance’ that mothers developed. Interpretation of data resulted in the identification of four key themes: ‘being sensitive to others’, ‘providing helping hands’, ‘monitoring health conditions’, and ‘maintaining dialogues’. The findings highlight Chinese mothers’ desire for participation in caring for their hospitalized child, their unexpressed needs for communication, and concern about being uncared by the busy health professionals, which affect their care for the child’s health outcomes. Conclusion: The findings facilitate the development of family-centred care focuses on partnership of care between the nurse and family to enhance the Chinese family’s active and participatory role.

N2  - Aims: To determine the accuracy of a wearable sensor to detect and differentiate episodes of self-reported craving and stress in individuals with substance use disorders, and to assess acceptability, barriers, and facilitators to sensor-based monitoring in this population. Methods: This was an observational mixed methods pilot study. Adults enrolled in an outpatient treatment program for a substance use disorder wore a non-invasive wrist-mounted sensor for four days and self-reported episodes of stress and craving. Continuous physiologic data (accelerometry, skin conductance, skin temperature, and heart rate) were extracted from the sensors and analyzed via various machine learning algorithms. Semi-structured interviews were conducted upon study completion, and thematic analysis was conducted on qualitative data from semi-structured interviews. Results: Thirty individuals completed the protocol, and 43 % (N = 13) were female. A total of 41 craving and 104 stress events were analyzed. The differentiation accuracies of the top performing models were as follows: stress vs. non-stress states 74.5 % (AUC 0.82), craving vs. no-craving 75.7 % (AUC 0.82), and craving vs. stress 76.8 % (AUC 0.8). Overall participant perception was positive, and acceptability was high. Emergent themes from the exit interviews included a perception of connectedness and increased mindfulness related to wearing the sensor, both of which were reported as helpful to recovery. Barriers to engagement included interference with other daily wear items, and perceived stigma. Conclusions: Wearable sensors can be used to objectively differentiate episodes of craving and stress, and individuals in recovery from substance use disorder are accepting of continuous monitoring with these devices.

N2  - Knowledge workers face many challenges in the workplace: work is fragmented, disruptions are constant, tasks are complex, and work hours can be long. These challenges can affect knowledge workers’ stress, focus and awakeness, and in turn their interaction with the digital environment, the quality of work performed and their productivity in general. We report on a field study with 14 knowledge workers over an eight-week period in which we investigated, using experience sampling, how the workers experience stress and awakeness over time. During this field study, we also collected biometric data including heart- and skin-related measures, which we then used to investigate if it is possible to predict stress, focus and awakeness, in the moment. We observed and report on various trends in knowledge worker stress and awakeness levels over several weeks, finding that people tend to have certain “baseline” levels for these aspects. Moreover, we found that days with high levels of stress tend to cluster, similarly as the days with low awakeness. We further show that machine learning models can be built from the data of a single minimally invasive device to predict stress, focus, and awakeness. Overall, we found that our models were capable of large improvements in precision and recall in comparison to a random classifier for stress (25.9% increase over random for precision, 4.2% for recall) and awakeness (52.4% increase in precision, 40.8% in recall). The abstract concept of focus proved to be the hardest to predict (26.0% increase in precision, 27.8% decrease in recall). (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  -  As a countermeasure to an increasing occurrence of mental illness worldwide, monitoring mental health has received significant attention. The application of artificial intelligence to mental health has immense potential to personalise treatment selection, monitoring, reoccurrence prediction, diagnosis, and prevention of disorders of mental well-being before they are symptomatic at clinical levels and even treating them. Therefore, in this paper, a Deep learning-based integrated psychological activity monitoring system (DLIPAMS) has been proposed to predict the anxiety and depression of humans. For a prediction of mental illness, the nature of machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence can be fully exploited. When implemented in real-time, these systems can support society by serving as a monitoring tool for individuals with immoral behaviour. The data has been pre-processed using the correlation-based filtering approach, and the essential features have been selected. The responses to the questionnaire derived from the target group were first exposed to deep learning strategies. By calculating the dice coefficient ratio, the labels obtained as a result of the classification, and it has been validated. These cluster labels were used to create classifications to predict an individual's mental health. The target groups were populations from various groups such as high school graduates, university students, and job professionals. The work analyzes how the above deep learning methods are adapted to the target groups and suggests guidelines for future practices. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) implicates a huge burden for patients and society. Although currently available antidepressants are effective treatment options, more than 50 % of the patients do not respond to the first administered antidepressant. In addition, in more than 25 % with antidepressants-treated patients, adverse effects occur. Currently, the selection of treatment does not reflect objectively measurable data from neurobiological and behavioral systems. However, in the last decades, the understanding of the impact of genetic variants on clinical features such as drug metabolism has grown and can be used to develop tests that enable a patient-tailored individual treatment. In fact, robust evidence was found that genetic variants of CYP450 enzymes such as CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 can be surrogate markers for the metabolism of certain drugs. This article describes a pilot study design aimed to combine clinical variables such as therapeutic drug monitoring, inflammatory and stress markers with static and variable genetic information of depressed patients to develop an algorithm that predicts treatment response, and tolerability using machine learning algorithms. Psychometric evaluation covers the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, and adverse drug reactions. An in-depth (epi-) genetic assessment combines genome-wide gene association data with DNA methylation patterns of genes coding CYP enzymes along with a pharmacogenetic battery focusing on CYP enzymes. Using these measures to stratify depressed patients, this approach should contribute to a data-driven assessment and management of MDD, which can be referred to as precision medicine or high-definition medicine.

N2  - The purpose of this exploratory study was to investigate whether there is a relationship between individuals' attachment styles and how they monitor their former romantic partners on Facebook. Additionally, this study investigated patterns that emerged when exploring breakup distress, relationship satisfaction, as well as demographic variables, and Facebook monitoring of former partners. A total of 82 individuals between the ages of 18 and 35 completed this online questionnaire. Participants responded to the Experiences in Close Relationships-Revised (ECR-R) Scale, a 36-item questionnaire that measures participants' attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance in romantic relationships. Using the results from the ECR-R participants were separated into four attachment categories: secure, fearful, dismissing and preoccupied. Participants also responded to the researcher-generated Facebook Involvement Scale to measure how often they were monitoring their former partners on Facebook, the Breakup Distress (BDS) scale to measure breakup related distress, and finally the Factors in Intimate Relationships (FIR) Scale to gather information regarding the participants' satisfaction in their prior relationships. The data was analyzed through correlations and ANOVAs. Data analysis suggests that the participants in this study sample with attachment styles of secure, fearful or dismissing were all monitoring their former romantic partners on Facebook at the same rate. However, when looking at participants with preoccupied attachment styles, data suggests that participants with preoccupied attachment styles were monitoring their former partners on Facebook at a significantly higher rate than participants with secure attachment styles. Additional data analysis of study variables showed a positive correlation between breakup distress and Facebook monitoring. Results suggest that the males in this study sample were monitoring their former romantic partners on Facebook at significantly higher rates than the females in this study sample. Results also suggest that participants whose relationships ended within the last year were checking the Facebook pages of their former partners at significantly higher rates than participants whose relationships ended over a year ago.

N2  - Parents raising children with Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) experience high levels of parenting stress, especially when ADHD is accompanied by comorbid Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ADHD/ODD). Children with ADHD experience difficulties with their executive functions in such areas as inhibition control, working memory, and emotional regulation. Despite evidence linking ADHD with parenting stress, and ADHD with executive function difficulties (EFDs), there is little research exploring whether EFDs within an ADHD population are associated with parenting stress. This dissertation's main objective is to determine whether parent-reported and teacher-reported childhood EFDs are associated with elevated levels of parenting stress. A secondary data analysis was completed on a cross-section of parent and teacher completed psychiatric assessment measures for children (n=243) diagnosed with ADHD. Measures included the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function, the Conners' Parent Rating Scale and the Parenting Stress Index, Long Form. A number of important findings were produced; key of which was the finding that a strong association exists between parent-reported EFDs and Child Domain parenting stress. Consistent with prior ADHD research, difficulties with emotional control and inhibition were found to be potent predictors of Child Domain parenting stress. To a lesser degree, children's difficulties with initiation and self-monitoring were associated with Child Domain parenting stress, suggesting that daily hassles pose challenges for parents, especially when the child attends a new school. Also important was the finding that parent-reported oppositionality partially mediated the relationship between EFDs with emotional control, inhibition and shift, and Child Domain parenting stress. Despite teachers' reports that children displayed more severe behaviours than were reported by parents, teacher-reported EFDs were not significantly associated with Child Domain parenting stress, with a few exceptions. Although not a well-explored concept within the literature on ADHD and parenting stress, parental acceptance of the child emerged as source of Child Domain parenting stress and a potential focus for assessment and treatment. Findings from the current study suggest that early identification and intervention with emotional control difficulties and ODD are vital due to their strong association with clinically significant levels of Child Domain parenting stress.

N2  - Study Objectives: The development of ambulatory technologies capable of monitoring brain activity during sleep longitudinally is critical for advancing sleep science. The aim of this study was to assess the signal acquisition and the performance of the automatic sleep staging algorithms of a reduced-montage dry-electroencephalographic (EEG) device (Dreem headband, DH) compared to the gold-standard polysomnography (PSG) scored by five sleep experts. Methods: A total of 25 subjects who completed an overnight sleep study at a sleep center while wearing both a PSG and the DH simultaneously have been included in the analysis. We assessed (1) similarity of measured EEG brain waves between the DH and the PSG; (2) the heart rate, breathing frequency, and respiration rate variability (RRV) agreement between the DH and the PSG; and (3) the performance of the DH’s automatic sleep staging according to American Academy of Sleep Medicine guidelines versus PSG sleep experts manual scoring. Results: The mean percentage error between the EEG signals acquired by the DH and those from the PSG for the monitoring of α was 15 ± 3.5%, 16 ± 4.3% for β, 16 ± 6.1% for λ, and 10 ± 1.4% for θ frequencies during sleep. The mean absolute error for heart rate, breathing frequency, and RRV was 1.2 ± 0.5 bpm, 0.3 ± 0.2 cpm, and 3.2 ± 0.6%, respectively. Automatic sleep staging reached an overall accuracy of 83.5 ± 6.4% (F1 score: 83.8 ± 6.3) for the DH to be compared with an average of 86.4 ± 8.0% (F1 score: 86.3 ± 7.4) for the 5 sleep experts. Conclusions: These results demonstrate the capacity of the DH to both monitor sleep-related physiological signals and process them accurately into sleep stages. This device paves the way for, large-scale, longitudinal sleep studies. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - The purpose of this descriptive qualitative study was to understand what female perceptions were of their experience of being a survivor of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) by a family member, and how implementing forgiveness as a coping skill affected their relationship towards their perpetrator. Data were obtained by interviewing 12 women, aged 18 and over, who experienced childhood sexual abuse by a family member, and implemented forgiveness as a coping skill toward their perpetrator, in a Southeastern metro area. Theoretical foundations for the study were built upon three theories: psychoanalytic theory, stress and coping theory, and Enright's 4-phase forgiveness theory. The Braun and Clark thematic analysis was utilized to identify patterns and themes within the qualitative data. NVivo data analysis allowed the researcher to import the transcribed interviews, perform queries, and search data. This allowed the researcher to gain frequency counts for most occurring words for developing codes, subthemes, and themes. Nine themes emerged from the analysis: symptoms of trauma, impact of CSA, support system, lack of parental protection and monitoring, disclosure, coping, positive perception, forgiveness as a process and journey, and community connection and giving back. Findings revealed that for each woman, the forgiveness process was unique and nonlinear; all participants were motivated in some way to let go of the unforgiveness and find freedom from stress caused by the transgression. The findings of this study may assist counselors, social workers, and other health workers in identifying interventions that may improve the client's life or mental health.

N2  - Background: To provide obstetric care which meets the needs of pregnant women with fear of childbirth (FOC), a deeper understanding is required of the beliefs of these women regarding their impending birth and the coping resources they possess to cope with their fear.Methods: Problem-centred interviews were carried out with 12 pregnant women who self-reported high FOC. Data analysis was performed using Bohnsack’s Documentary Method to reconstruct collective frames of orientation and implicit and explicit orientations in daily practice and interaction.Results: The interviewees see birth as a field of tension between the poles of naturalness and medicalization. Their need for information displays a need to be in control and fear of losing control. Medical and technological monitoring and one-to-one care promote security. Pregnant women with FOC want to know how they can contribute to a physiological birth.Conclusions: Structural, organizational and conceptual changes in obstetric care are needed to cater to the needs of pregnant women with FOC. Alongside the need for evidence-based information about non-medical and medical pain-relief as well as decision-making aids, the provision of a continuity model of midwifery care is important.

N2  - Aims: To explore the coping strategies of Chinese family caregivers of stroke-impaired older relatives. Background: Many stroke-impaired patients rely heavily on support from their families, and the daily lives of such family caregivers are severely impacted. However, services and support for family caregivers of stroke-impaired relatives in the home setting have received little attention. Appropriate and relevant information and support to family caregivers are important in facilitating the care-giving task. It is, therefore, necessary to understand the nature and demands of care-giving before planning specific educational and support programmes. Design: Grounded theory. Methods: Fifteen Chinese family caregivers of stroke-impaired older relatives were recruited and interviewed in 2003 and 2004. Theoretical sampling and constant comparative analysis were used to recruit the sample and perform data analysis. Results: Seeking harmony to provide care for the stroke-impaired was the core category for describing and guiding the family care-giving process, with five main stages: (1) living with ambiguity, (2) monitoring the recovery progress, (3) accepting the downfalls, (4) meeting family obligations and (5) reconciling with harmony. These issues were seldom discussed openly with health professionals. Conclusions: The findings indicated that Chinese family caregivers determine their own needs by seeking harmony to continue to provide care without thinking about getting help from others or their own health problems. These findings help to define some of the complex dynamics that have an impact on the development of partnership care and might challenge nurses practising in the community. Relevance to clinical practice: Community nurses should assess and understand the coping strategies of family caregivers and assist them to engage in stress-reducing practices. This is an important partnership to be formed in stroke care for family caregivers in the community. The study findings will guide further development of family care-giving aspects in nursing practice. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: New technologies may profoundly change our way of understanding psychiatric disorders including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Imaging and biomarkers, along with technological and medical informatics developments, might provide an answer regarding at-risk patient’s identification. Recent advances in the concept of ‘digital phenotype’, which refers to the capture of characteristics of a psychiatric disorder by computerized measurement tools, is one paradigmatic example. Objective: The impact of the new technologies on health professionals practice in PTSD care remains to be determined. The recent evolutions could disrupt the clinical practices and practitioners in their beliefs, ethics and representations, going as far as questioning their professional culture. In the present paper, we conducted an extensive search to highlight the articles which reflect the potential of these new technologies. Method: We conducted an overview by querying PubMed database with the terms [PTSD] [Posttraumatic stress disorder] AND [Computer] OR [Computerized] OR [Mobile] OR [Automatic] OR [Automated] OR [Machine learning] OR [Sensor] OR [Heart rate variability] OR [HRV] OR [actigraphy] OR [actimetry] OR [digital] OR [motion] OR [temperature] OR [virtual reality]. Results: We summarized the synthesized literature in two categories: prediction and assessment (including diagnostic, screening and monitoring). Two independent reviewers screened, extracted data and quality appraised the sources. Results were synthesized narratively. Conclusions: This overview shows that many studies are underway allowing researchers to start building a PTSD digital phenotype using passive data obtained by biometric sensors. Active data obtained from Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) could allow clinicians to assess PTSD patients. The place of connected objects, Artificial Intelligence and remote monitoring of patients with psychiatric pathology remains to be defined. These tools must be explained and adapted to the different profiles of physicians and patients. The involvement of patients, caregivers and health professionals is essential to the design and evaluation of these new tools. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyse the clinical outcome data collected as part of an 18-week, abstinence-based residential therapeutic community (TC) programme, Higher Ground Drug Rehabilitation Trust (Higher Ground) in New Zealand. Lessons and implications for routine collection of clinical outcome data are identified. Design/methodology/approach: Higher Ground collects longitudinal data on all consenting clients using a battery of validated psychometric tools, with repeated measures at up to nine points in time from first presentation through to 12-month post-discharge follow up. Data analysis covered clients who entered Higher Ground between 1 July 2012 and 2 June 2015 (n = 524). Findings: Clients presented with histories of addiction which often had significant negative associations with their physical and psychological health, their relationships, work, accommodation and criminal behaviour. By the time they exited the programme, clinically and statistically significant improvements were seen across multiple indicators including: substance use and abstinence; symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety and stress; and a range of social indicators. Research limitations/implications: Attrition in follow-up research is a significant challenge, with people completing the TC programme being more likely to participate than those who do not. This limits generalizability in post-discharge data. There was no control group, making causal attribution a challenge. Identifying suitable benchmarks from the literature is challenging because of the variety of outcome measures and research methodologies used. Practical implications: Tracking client outcomes longitudinally using psychometric tools is potentially valuable for TCs and their funding bodies, as it provides insights into patterns of client recovery that can inform ongoing service improvements and resource allocation decisions. However, significant challenges remain. Originality/value: The study demonstrates the value, and practical challenges, of collecting high-quality outcome data in a TC setting.

N2  - An avoidant grief style is marked by repeated and often unsuccessful attempts to prevent thinking about loss. Prior work shows avoidant grief involves monitoring the external environment in order to avoid reminders of the loss. Here we sought to determine whether avoidant grievers also monitor the internal environment in attempts to minimize conscious awareness of loss-related thoughts. Individuals bereaved of a first-degree relative, spouse or partner within the last 14 months participated in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study (N = 29). We first applied machine learning to train neural patterns for attentional control and representation of the deceased (N = 23). The attentional pattern was trained using fMRI data from a modified Stroop task assessing selective attention to reminders of the deceased. The representational pattern was trained using fMRI data from a task presenting pictures and stories of the deceased. We observed spontaneous fluctuations in these processes occurring during a neutral mindwandering fMRI task (N = 27). At higher levels of avoidant grieving, activation of attentional control disrupted the relationship between the representational process and thoughts of loss. These findings show that avoidant grief involves attentional control to reduce the likelihood that deceased-related representations reach full conscious awareness.

N2  - Stress reactivity is a complex phenomenon associated to multiple and multimodal expressions. Response to stressors has an obvious survival function and may be seen as an internal regulation to adapt to threat or danger. The intensity of this internal response can be assessed as the self-perception of the stress response. In species with social organization, this response also serves a communicative function, so-called hetero-perception. Our study presents multimodal stress detection assessment—a new methodology combining behavioral imaging and physiological monitoring for analyzing stress from these two perspectives. The system is based on automatic extraction of 39 behavioral (2D + 3D video recording) and 62 physiological (Nexus-10 recording) features during a socially evaluated mental arithmetic test. The analysis with machine learning techniques for automatic classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM) show that self-perception and hetero-perception of social stress are both close but different phenomena: self-perception was significantly correlated with hetero-perception but significantly differed from it. Also, assessing stress with SVM through multimodality gave excellent classification results (F1 score values: 0.9 ± 0.012 for hetero-perception and 0.87 ± 0.021 for self-perception). In the best selected feature subsets, we found some common behavioral and physiological features that allow classification of both self- and hetero-perceived stress. However, we also found the contributing features for automatic classifications had opposite distributions: self-perception classification was mainly based on physiological features and hetero-perception was mainly based on behavioral features.

N2  - Objectives: To examine the incremental identification of emotional distress in mothers of hospitalized newborns by screening for anxiety in addition to depression and to provide practical information about anxiety screening scales to facilitate instrument selection and screening implementation by nurses in the NICU. Design: In this secondary data analysis, screening data from the recruitment phase of a feasibility trial to evaluate a nurse-delivered counseling intervention for emotionally distressed mothers of newborns in the NICU were used to examine the effect of anxiety screening. Setting: A Level IV NICU at a large academic medical center in the Midwestern United States. Participants: Women 18 years of age and older (N = 190) with newborns in the NICU. Methods: Participants completed multiple measures of depression and anxiety symptoms. Results: Of participants who had negative screening results on a depression-only screening instrument, 4.7% to 14.7% endorsed clinically significant anxiety symptoms depending on the screening instrument used. Conclusion: Screening for anxiety in mothers of newborns in the NICU resulted in identification of distressed mothers who would otherwise have been missed during routine depression-only screening. Multiple options for anxiety screening exist that add incremental information to depression-only screening and require little additional burden on providers and mothers of newborns in the NICU.

N2  - Background: Comparative effectiveness research uses multiple tools, but lacks outcome measures to assess large electronic medical records and claims data. Aggregate changes in medications in response to clinical need may serve as a surrogate outcome measure. We developed the Medication Recommendation Tracking Form (MRTF) to record the frequency, types, and reasons for medication adjustments in order to calculate Necessary Clinical Adjustments (NCAs), medication adjustments to reduce symptoms, maximize treatment response, or address problematic side effects. Methods: The MRTF was completed at every visit for 482 adult patients in Bipolar CHOICE, a 6-month randomized comparative effectiveness trial. Results: Responders had significantly fewer NCAs compared to non-responders. NCAs predicted subsequent response status such that every additional NCA during the previous visit decreased a patient's odds of response by approximately 30%. Patients with more severe symptoms had a greater number of NCAs at the subsequent visit. Patients with a comorbid anxiety disorder demonstrated a significantly higher rate of NCAs per month than those without a comorbid anxiety disorder. Patients with greater frequency, intensity, and interference of side effects had higher rates of NCAs. Participants with fewer NCAs reported a higher quality of life and decreased functional impairment. Limitations: The MRTF has not been examined in community clinic settings and did not predict response more efficiently than the Clinical Global Impression-Bipolar Version (CGI-BP). Conclusions: The MRTF is a feasible proxy of clinical outcome, with implications for clinical training and decision-making. Analyses of big data could use changes in medications as a surrogate outcome measure. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Suicide is one of the leading causes of death among adolescents, and developing effective methods to improve short-term prediction of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) is critical. Currently, the most robust predictors of STBs are demographic or clinical indicators that have relatively weak predictive value. However, there is an emerging literature on short-term prediction of suicide risk that has identified a number of promising candidates, including (but not limited to) rapid escalation of: (a) emotional distress, (b) social dysfunction (e.g., bullying, rejection), and (c) sleep disturbance. However, these prior studies are limited in two critical ways. First, they rely almost entirely on self-report. Second, most studies have not focused on assessment of these risk factors using intensive longitudinal assessment techniques that are able to capture the dynamics of changes in risk states at the individual level. Method: In this paper we explore how to capitalize on recent developments in real-time monitoring methods and computational analysis in order to address these fundamental problems. Results: We now have the capacity to use: (a) smartphone, wearable computing, and smart home technology to conduct intensive longitudinal assessments monitoring of putative risk factors with minimal participant burden and (b) modern computational techniques to develop predictive algorithms for STBs. Current research and theory on short-term risk processes for STBs, combined with the emergent capabilities of new technologies, suggest that this is an important research agenda for the future. Limitations: Although these approaches have enormous potential to create new knowledge, the current empirical literature is limited. Moreover, passive monitoring of risk for STBs raises complex ethical issues that will need to be resolved before large scale clinical applications are feasible. Conclusions: Smartphone, wearable, and smart home technology may provide one point of access that might facilitate both early identification and intervention implementation, and thus, represents a key area for future STB research.

N2  - Objective: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a systemic and multifactorial disorder that involves abnormalities in multiple biochemical pathways and the autonomic nervous system. This study applied a machine-learning method to classify MDD and control groups by incorporating data from serum proteomic analysis and heart rate variability (HRV) analysis for the identification of novel peripheral biomarkers. Methods: The study subjects consisted of 25 drug-free female MDD patients and 25 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. First, quantitative serum proteome profiles were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry using pooled serum samples from 10 patients and 10 controls. Next, candidate proteins were quantified with multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) in 50 subjects. We also analyzed 22 linear and nonlinear HRV parameters in 50 subjects. Finally, we identified a combined biomarker panel consisting of proteins and HRV indexes using a support vector machine with recursive feature elimination. Results: A separation between MDD and control groups was achieved using five parameters (apolipoprotein B, group-specific component, ceruloplasmin, RMSSD, and SampEn) at 80.1% classification accuracy. A combination of HRV and proteomic data achieved better classification accuracy. Conclusions: A high classification accuracy can be achieved by combining multimodal information from heart rate dynamics and serum proteomics in MDD. Our approach can be helpful for accurate clinical diagnosis of MDD. Further studies using larger, independent cohorts are needed to verify the role of these candidate biomarkers for MDD diagnosis.

This special issue presents the papers based on the keynote presentations and invited panel discussions during the 14th Conference of the European Society of Traumatic Stress studies. The majority of these papers are related to the overarching conference theme: "Trauma in changing societies: social contexts and clinical practice." With this special issue that presents highlights of the biennial psychotrauma conference in Europe with contributions from experts inside and outside Europe, we hope to boost future research on the role of the broader social context in which trauma occurs. This offers many possibilities for novel research topics and methods. To name a few, big data studies may examine the use of social media, and specific characteristics of communication between individuals early after mass trauma by tracking smartphone data.

N2  - The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has recently emphasized the importance of analyzing flight data as one of the most effective methods to improve eciency and safety of helicopter operations. By analyzing flight data with Flight Data Monitoring (FDM) programs, the safety and performance of helicopter operations can be evaluated and improved. In spite of the NTSB's effort, the safety of helicopter operations has not improved at the same rate as the safety of worldwide airlines, and the accident rate of helicopters continues to be much higher than that of fixed-wing aircraft. One of the main reasons is that the participation rates of the rotorcraft industry in the FDM programs are low due to the high costs of the Flight Data Recorder (FDR), the need of a special readout device to decode the FDR, anxiety of punitive action, etc. Since a video camera is easily installed, accessible, and inexpensively maintained, cockpit video data could complement the FDR in the presence of the FDR or possibly replace the role of the FDR in the absence of the FDR. Cockpit video data is composed of image and audio data: image data contains outside views through cockpit windows and activities on the flight instrument panels, whereas audio data contains sounds of the alarms within the cockpit. The goal of this research is to develop, test, and demonstrate a cockpit video data analysis algorithm based on data mining and signal processing techniques that can help better understand situations in the cockpit and the state of a helicopter by efficiently and accurately inferring the useful flight information from cockpit video data. Image processing algorithms based on data mining techniques are proposed to estimate a helicopter's attitude such as the bank and pitch angles, identify indicators from a flight instrument panel, and read the gauges and the numbers in the analogue gauge indicators and digital displays from cockpit image data. In addition, an audio processing algorithm based on signal processing and abrupt change detection techniques is proposed to identify types of warning alarms and to detect the occurrence times of individual alarms from cockpit audio data. Those proposed algorithms are then successfully applied to simulated and real helicopter cockpit video data to demonstrate and validate their performance.

N2  - Advanced manufacturing has resulted in significant changes on the shop-floor, influencing work demands and the working environment. The corresponding safety-related effects, including fatigue, have not been captured on an industry-wide scale. This paper presents results of a survey of U.S. manufacturing workers for the: prevalence of fatigue, its root causes and significant factors, and adopted individual fatigue coping methods. The responses from 451 manufacturing employees were analyzed using descriptive data analysis, bivariate analysis and Market Basket Analysis. 57.9% of respondents indicated that they were somewhat fatigued during the past week. They reported the ankles/feet, lower back and eyes were frequently affected body parts and a lack of sleep, work stress and shift schedule were top selected root causes for fatigue. In order to respond to fatigue when it is present, respondents reported coping by drinking caffeinated drinks, stretching/doing exercises and talking with coworkers. Frequent combinations of fatigue causes and individual coping methods were identified. These results may inform the design of fatigue monitoring and mitigation strategies and future research related to fatigue development. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Admission to the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) for long-term video-electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring (VEEG) constitutes the gold standard for seizure diagnosis and presurgical evaluation. This study applied the concept of a high-frequency systematic monitoring of psychological states and tested patients' compliance in order to evaluate if its integration in the EMU is feasible and if patients benefit from the graphically underpinned discussion of their EMU stay-related cognitions and emotions. Methods: The process-monitoring is technically realized by an internet-based device for data collection and data analysis, the Synergetic Navigation System (SNS). A convenient sample was enrolled: All eligible patients who were admitted to the EMU of the Department of Neurology, Christian Doppler Medical Center, Salzburg, Austria, between November 6th 2017 and January 26th 2018 were approached and recruited upon consent. After a short resource-oriented interview, each enrolled patient was provided with a tablet. The daily questionnaire included eight standardized and up to three personalized items. Self-assessments were collected every 5 h prior to meal times (6:30 am, 11:30 am, and 4:30 pm) and at 9:30 pm. The detailed visualizations of the patients' replies were discussed with the participants during a feedback session at the end of the EMU stay. Results: Twenty-one patients (12 women/9 men, median age 29 years [range 18–74 years]) were consecutively recruited (72% of all eligible patients). Compliance rates were high (median: 82%, range 60%–100%) among the respondents. Mood correlated strongly with hopefulness (r = 0.71) and moderately with energy (r = 0.63) in all patients. When correlating the intraindividual medians of the process questionnaire time series with the pretest total scores, energy correlated moderately and negatively with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) (r = −0.45), while self-efficacy correlated moderately and negatively with the Neurological Disorders Depression Inventory for Epilepsy (NDDI-E) total scores in all patients (r = −0.5). Nine patients (43%) reported that they learned something meaningful about themselves after the feedback discussion of their individual time series. Conclusion: The results support the feasibility of high-frequency monitoring of psychological states and processes in routine EMU settings. Repeated daily collections four times per day of psychological surveys allow for the assessment of highly resolved, equidistant time series data, which gives insight into psychological states and processes during EMU admission.

N2  - Objective: The feasibility of a high-frequency real-time monitoring approach to psychotherapy is outlined and tested for patients’ compliance to evaluate its integration to everyday practice. Criteria concern the ecological momentary assessment, the assessment of therapy-related cognitions and emotions, equidistant time sampling, real-time nonlinear time series analysis, continuous participative process control by client and therapist, and the application of idiographic (person-specific) surveys. Methods: The process-outcome monitoring is technically realized by an internet-based device for data collection and data analysis, the Synergetic Navigation System. Its feasibility is documented by a compliance study on 151 clients treated in an inpatient and a day-treatment clinic. Results: We found high compliance rates (mean: 78.3%, median: 89.4%) amongst the respondents, independent of the severity of symptoms or the degree of impairment. Compared to other diagnoses, the compliance rate was lower in the group diagnosed with personality disorders. Conclusion: The results support the feasibility of high-frequency monitoring in routine psychotherapy settings. Daily collection of psychological surveys allows for the assessment of highly resolved, equidistant time series data which gives insight into the nonlinear qualities of therapeutic change processes (e.g., pattern transitions, critical instabilities).

N2  - During crisis events, people often seek out event-related information to stay informed of what is happening. However, when information from official channels is lacking or disseminated irregularly, people may be at risk for exposure to rumors that fill the information void. We studied information-seeking during a university lockdown following an active-shooter event. In study 1, students in the lockdown (n = 3,890) completed anonymous surveys 1 week later. Those who indicated receiving conflicting information about the lockdown reported greater acute stress [standardized regression coefficient (b) = 0.07; SE = 0.01; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.04, 0.10]. Additionally, those who reported direct contact with close others via text message (or phone) and used Twitter for critical updates during the lockdown were exposed to more conflicting information. Higher acute stress was reported by heavy social media users who trusted social media for critical updates (b = 0.06, SE = 0.01; 95%CI, 0.03, 0.10). In study 2, we employed a big data approach to explore the time course of rumor transmission across 5 hours surrounding the lockdown within a subset of the university’s Twitter followers. We also examined the patterning of distress in the hours during the lockdown as rumors about what was happening (e.g., presence of multiple shooters) spread among Twitter users. During periods without updates from official channels, rumors and distress increased. Results highlight the importance of releasing substantive updates at regular intervals during a crisis event and monitoring social media for rumors to mitigate rumor exposure and distress.

N2  - This study examined the associations of prenatal psychosocial factors, including depressive symptoms, post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, trauma exposure including intimate partner violence, perceived stress, and social support, with perceived postpartum health status. Low-income Latinas (N = 203) were recruited from two health plans within the first 12 weeks of their pregnancies and followed through 3 months after birth. Participants completed semi-structured interviews conducted in English or Spanish within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, and again at 12 weeks postpartum. Perceived health status was measured by the SF-12. Participants with complete follow-up data (n = 193) were used in data analysis. Women were mostly foreign-born (75%) with low-incomes (59%) and reported postpartum health status in the average range (M = 102.5; SD = 12.2). Overall health status was positively associated with decreased levels of perceived stress (P P = .003). Emotional well-being was positively linked with being foreign-born and having resided in the US P = .002), increased levels of social support (P = .01), and decreased levels of perceived stress (P P = .01) and health problems experienced during pregnancy or delivery (P = .05) were negatively associated with physical health status. Prenatal psychosocial factors and length of residency in the US are differentially predictive of overall postpartum health status and emotional well-being, and have less impact on physical well-being after birth. Health professionals are encouraged to assess these factors in early pregnancy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Chronotye is associated with age, sex, personality, and parental monitoring during childhood. The evening type is associated with poor school performance, sleep problems, anxious/depressive symptoms, tobacco smoking, caffeine consumption, alcohol drinking, and suicidality in adolescents. The present study tested the relationships between chronotype and a wide range of psychopathology and personality traits among 2919 incoming undergraduate students. Each participant completed a self-administered questionnaire that included demographics, plus the Morningness-Eveningness (M-E) scale, Brief Symptom Rating Scale (BSRS), Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire, and Maudesley Personality Inventory. The t-score distribution of the M-E scale was used to form the morning (t-score >60, n = 419), evening (t-score t-score ≤ 60, n = 2129) groups. Multivariable regression was employed for data analysis. For males, the evening type scored higher on all subscales of the BSRS than the morning type, except phobic anxiety. For females, the evening type had higher scores than the other two types on all subscales, except in obsession/compulsion and phobic anxiety, where the evening type only scored higher than the intermediate type. The evening type of both sexes also scored higher than the morning type in novelty seeking, harm avoidance, and neurotic personality characteristics, but lower than the morning type in extraversion and social desirability. In reward dependence, the evening type scored lowest for males, but there was no difference for females. The findings of the evening type being associated with possible psychopathology and certain types of personality have public health implications, that is, chronotype needs to be taken into account in the development of mental health prevention programs and assessment of and intervention for mental problems in young adults.

N2  - Importance: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is poorly understood compared with other anxiety disorders, and debates persist about the seriousness of this disorder. Few data exist on GAD outside a small number of affluent, industrialized nations. No population-based data exist on GAD as it is currently defined in DSM-5. Objective: To provide the first epidemiologic data on DSM-5 GAD and explore cross-national differences in its prevalence, course, correlates, and impact. Design, setting, and participants: Data come from the World Health Organization World Mental Health Survey Initiative. Cross-sectional general population surveys were carried out in 26 countries using a consistent research protocol and assessment instrument. A total of 147 261 adults from representative household samples were interviewed face-to-face in the community. The surveys were conducted between 2001 and 2012. Data analysis was performed from July 22, 2015, to December 12, 2016. Main outcomes and measures: The Composite International Diagnostic Interview was used to assess GAD along with comorbid disorders, role impairment, and help seeking. Results: Respondents were 147 261 adults aged 18 to 99 years. The surveys had a weighted mean response rate of 69.5%. Across surveys, DSM-5 GAD had a combined lifetime prevalence (SE) of 3.7%(0.1%), 12-month prevalence of 1.8%(0.1%), and 30-day prevalence of 0.8%(0). Prevalence estimates varied widely across countries, with lifetime prevalence highest in high-income countries (5.0% [0.1%]), lower in middle-income countries (2.8% [0.1%]), and lowest in low-income countries (1.6%[0.1%]). Generalized anxiety disorder typically begins in adulthood and persists over time, although onset is later and clinical course is more persistent in lower-income countries. Lifetime comorbidity is high (81.9% [0.7%]), particularly with mood (63.0%[0.9%]) and other anxiety (51.7%[0.9%]) disorders. Severe role impairment is common across life domains (50.6%[1.2%]), particularly in high-income countries. Treatment is sought by approximately half of affected individuals (49.2%[1.2%]), especially those with severe role impairment (59.4%[1.8%]) or comorbid disorders (55.8% [1.4%]) and those living in high-income countries (59.0%[1.3%]). Conclusions and relevance: The findings of this study show that DSM-5 GAD is more prevalent than DSM-IV GAD and is associated with substantial role impairment. The disorder is especially common and impairing in high-income countries despite a negative association between GAD and socioeconomic status within countries. These results underscore the public health significance of GAD across the globe while uncovering cross-national differences in prevalence, course, and impairment that require further investigation.

N2  - Purpose: To investigate online search activity of suicide-related words in South Korean adolescents through data mining of social media Web sites as the suicide rate in South Korea is one of the highest in the world. Methods: Out of more than 2.35 billion posts for 2 years from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2012 on 163 social media Web sites in South Korea, 99,693 suicide-related documents were retrieved by Crawler and analyzed using text mining and opinion mining. These data were further combined with monthly employment rate, monthly rental prices index, monthly youth suicide rate, and monthly number of reported bully victims to fit multilevel models as well as structural equation models. Results: The link from grade pressure to suicide risk showed the largest standardized path coefficient (beta = .357, p p < .01) in multilevel models. Depression was a partial mediator between suicide risk and grade pressure, low body image, victims of bullying, and concerns about disease. The largest total effect was observed in the grade pressure to depression to suicide risk. The multilevel models indicate about 27% of the variance in the daily suicide-related word search activity is explained by month-to-month variations. A lower employment rate, a higher rental prices index, and more bullying were associated with an increased suicide-related word search activity. Conclusions: Academic pressure appears to be the biggest contributor to Korean adolescents' suicide risk. Real-time suicide-related word search activity monitoring and response system needs to be developed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: The Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R) is a widely used symptomatic distress questionnaire. A translated version of the SCL-90-R has been applied in Ukrainian general population surveys several times but has not yet been validated in this country. The SCL-90-R and its short versions (BSI-53, SCL-27, BSI-18, SCL-14 and SCL-9-K) were investigated in order to comparatively assess their properties and applications in Ukraine. Methods: Secondary analysis of three nationally representative cross-sectional surveys (1997, 1999 and 2014) using SCL-90-R was applied. Two thousand sixty nine respondents participated in 2014; the sample size for the 1997 and 1999 surveys was 1810 respondents per wave. Statistical data analysis is based on calculating internal consistencies with Cronbach’s Alpha, confirmatory factor analysis, nonparametric correlations and effect sizes for the equivalence of the full and short versions. Results: The scales of SCL-90-R and its shortened versions showed equally high internal consistencies. With regard to factorial validity, 2014 data confirmed the dimensional structure of all versions. Unsatisfactory results were found in 1997 and 1999 for SCL-90-R and in 1997 for SCL-27, based on the Chi-square criterion (χ2/degrees of freedom > 5), though other indexes suggested satisfactory model fit (RMSEA0.95). Analysis of the equivalence of shortened and full versions of the SCL-90-R has shown the presence of small effect sizes. Conclusion: BSI-18 and SCL-9-K are recommended for use in general population surveys as more economical versions of SCL-90-R. Both versions revealed satisfactory validity in 1997, 1999 and 2014.

N2  - The amygdala has a pivotal role in processing traumatic stress; hence, gaining control over its activity could facilitate adaptive mechanism and recovery. To date, amygdala volitional regulation could be obtained only via real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a highly inaccessible procedure. The current article presents high-impact neurobehavioral implications of a novel imaging approach that enables bedside monitoring of amygdala activity using fMRI-inspired electroencephalography (EEG), hereafter termed amygdala-electrical fingerprint (amyg-EFP). Simultaneous EEG/fMRI indicated that the amyg-EFP reliably predicts amygdala-blood oxygen level–dependent activity. Implementing the amyg-EFP in neurofeedback demonstrated that learned downregulation of the amyg-EFP facilitated volitional downregulation of amygdala-blood oxygen level–dependent activity via real-time fMRI and manifested as reduced amygdala reactivity to visual stimuli. Behavioral evidence further emphasized the therapeutic potential of this approach by showing improved implicit emotion regulation following amyg-EFP neurofeedback. Additional EFP models denoting different brain regions could provide a library of localized activity for low-cost and highly accessible brain-based diagnosis and treatment.

N2  - The use of adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) in neurobehavioral research is rapidly expanding. The present large-scale study applied the newest video-tracking and data-mining technologies to further examine zebrafish anxiety-like phenotypes. Here, we generated temporal and spatial three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of zebrafish locomotion, globally assessed behavioral profiles evoked by several anxiogenic and anxiolytic manipulations, mapped individual endpoints to 3D reconstructions, and performed cluster analysis to reconfirm behavioral correlates of high- and low-anxiety states. The application of 3D swim path reconstructions consolidates behavioral data (while increasing data density) and provides a novel way to examine and represent zebrafish behavior. It also enables rapid optimization of video tracking settings to improve quantification of automated parameters, and suggests that spatiotemporal organization of zebrafish swimming activity can be affected by various experimental manipulations in a manner predicted by their anxiolytic or anxiogenic nature. Our approach markedly enhances the power of zebrafish behavioral analyses, providing innovative framework for high-throughput 3D phenotyping of adult zebrafish behavior.

N2  - Importance: Biologic systems involved in the regulation of motor activity are intricately linked with other homeostatic systems such as sleep, feeding behavior, energy, and mood. Mobile monitoring technology (eg, actigraphy and ecological momentary assessment devices) allows the assessment of these multiple systems in real time. However, most clinical studies of mental disorders that use mobile devices have not focused on the dynamic associations between these systems. Objectives: To examine the directional associations among motor activity, energy, mood, and sleep using mobile monitoring in a community-identified sample, and to evaluate whether these within-day associations differ between people with a history of bipolar or other mood disorders and controls without mood disorders. Design, Setting, and Participants: This study used a nested case-control design of 242 adults, a subsample of a community-based sample of adults. Probands were recruited by mail from the greater Washington, DC, metropolitan area from January 2005 to June 2013. Enrichment of the sample for mood disorders was provided by volunteers or referrals from the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center or by participants in the National Institute of Mental Health Mood and Anxiety Disorders Program. The inclusion criteria were the ability to speak English, availability to participate, and consent to contact at least 2 living first-degree relatives. Data analysis was performed from June 2013 through July 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Motor activity and sleep duration data were obtained from minute-to-minute activity counts from an actigraphy device worn on the nondominant wrist for 2 weeks. Mood and energy levels were assessed by subjective analogue ratings on the ecological momentary assessment (using a personal digital assistant) by participants 4 times per day for 2 weeks. Results: Of the total 242 participants, 92 (38.1%) were men and 150 (61.9%) were women, with a mean (SD) age of 48 (16.9) years. Among the participants, 54 (22.3%) had bipolar disorder (25 with bipolar I; 29 with bipolar II), 91 (37.6%) had major depressive disorder, and 97 (40.1%) were controls with no history of mood disorders. A unidirectional association was found between motor activity and subjective mood level (β = –0.018, P = .04). Bidirectional associations were observed between motor activity (β = 0.176; P = .03) and subjective energy level (β = 0.027; P = .03) as well as between motor activity (β = –0.027; P = .04) and sleep duration (β = –0.154; P = .04). Greater cross-domain reactivity was observed in bipolar disorder across all outcomes, including motor activity, sleep, mood, and energy. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that interventions focused on motor activity and energy may have greater efficacy than current approaches that target depressed mood; both active and passive tracking of multiple regulatory systems are important in designing therapeutic targets.

N2  - Background: Wearable and mobile devices that capture multimodal data have the potential to identify risk factors for high stress and poor mental health and to provide information to improve health and well-being. Objective: We developed new tools that provide objective physiological and behavioral measures using wearable sensors and mobile phones, together with methods that improve their data integrity. The aim of this study was to examine, using machine learning, how accurately these measures could identify conditions of self-reported high stress and poor mental health and which of the underlying modalities and measures were most accurate in identifying those conditions. Methods: We designed and conducted the 1-month SNAPSHOT study that investigated how daily behaviors and social networks influence self-reported stress, mood, and other health or well-being-related factors. We collected over 145,000 hours of data from 201 college students (age: 18-25 years, male:female = 1.8:1) at one university, all recruited within self-identified social groups. Each student filled out standardized pre- and postquestionnaires on stress and mental health; during the month, each student completed twice-daily electronic diaries (e-diaries), wore two wrist-based sensors that recorded continuous physical activity and autonomic physiology, and installed an app on their mobile phone that recorded phone usage and geolocation patterns. We developed tools to make data collection more efficient, including data-check systems for sensor and mobile phone data and an e-diary administrative module for study investigators to locate possible errors in the e-diaries and communicate with participants to correct their entries promptly, which reduced the time taken to clean e-diary data by 69%. We constructed features and applied machine learning to the multimodal data to identify factors associated with self-reported poststudy stress and mental health, including behaviors that can be possibly modified by the individual to improve these measures. Results: We identified the physiological sensor, phone, mobility, and modifiable behavior features that were best predictors for stress and mental health classification. In general, wearable sensor features showed better classification performance than mobile phone or modifiable behavior features. Wearable sensor features, including skin conductance and temperature, reached 78.3% (148/189) accuracy for classifying students into high or low stress groups and 87% (41/47) accuracy for classifying high or low mental health groups. Modifiable behavior features, including number of naps, studying duration, calls, mobility patterns, and phone-screen-on time, reached 73.5% (139/189) accuracy for stress classification and 79% (37/47) accuracy for mental health classification. Conclusions: New semiautomated tools improved the efficiency of long-term ambulatory data collection from wearable and mobile devices. Applying machine learning to the resulting data revealed a set of both objective features and modifiable behavioral features that could classify self-reported high or low stress and mental health groups in a college student population better than previous studies and showed new insights into digital phenotyping.

N2  - Background: Physical activity is a potentially effective treatment for depression and depressive relapse. However, promoting physical activity in people with depression is challenging. Interventions informed by theory and evidence are therefore needed to support people with depression to become more physically active. eMotion is a Web-based intervention combining behavioral activation and physical activity promotion for people in the community with symptoms of depression. Objective: The objectives were to assess the feasibility and acceptability of delivering eMotion to people in the community with symptoms of depression and to explore outcomes. Methods: Participants with elevated depressive symptoms were recruited from the community through various methods (eg, social media) and randomized to eMotion or a waiting list control group for 8 weeks. eMotion is an administratively supported weekly modular program that helps people use key behavior change techniques (eg, graded tasks, action planning, and self-monitoring) to re-engage in routine, pleasurable, and necessary activities, with a focus on physical activities. Feasibility data were collected that included the following: recruitment and trial retention rates; fidelity of intervention delivery, receipt, and enactment; and acceptability of the intervention and data collection procedures. Data were collected for the primary (depression) and secondary outcomes (eg, anxiety, physical activity, fidelity, and client satisfaction) at baseline and 2 months postrandomization using self-reported Web-based questionnaires and accelerometers. Delivery fidelity (logins, modules accessed, time spent) was tracked using Web usage statistics. Exploratory analyses were conducted on the primary and secondary outcomes. Results: Of the 183 people who contacted the research team, 62 were recruited and randomized. The mean baseline score was 14.6 (SD 3.2) on the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale (PHQ-8). Of those randomized, 52 participants provided accelerometer-recorded physical activity data at baseline that showed a median of 35.8 (interquartile range [IQR] 0.0-98.6) minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) recorded in at least 10-minute bouts per week, with only 13% (7/52) people achieving guideline levels (150 minutes of MVPA per week). In total, 81% (50/62) of participants provided follow-up data for the primary outcome (PHQ-8), but only 39% (24/62) provided follow-up accelerometer data. Within the intervention group, the median number of logins, modules accessed, and total minutes spent on eMotion was 3 (IQR 2.0-8.0), 3 (IQR 2.0-5.0), and 41.3 (IQR 18.9-90.4), respectively. Acceptability was mixed. Exploratory data analysis showed that PHQ-8 levels were lower for the intervention group than for the control group at 2 months postrandomization (adjusted mean difference −3.6, 95% CI −6.1 to −1.1). Conclusions: It was feasible to deliver eMotion in UK communities to inactive populations. eMotion has the potential to be effective and is ready for testing in a full-scale trial. Further work is needed to improve engagement with both the intervention and data collection procedures. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Decades of research and more than 20 randomized controlled trials show that Virtual Reality exposure therapy (VRET) is effective in reducing fear and anxiety. Unfortunately, few providers or patients have had access to the costly and technical equipment previously required. Recent technological advances in the form of consumer Virtual Reality (VR) systems (e.g. Oculus Rift and Samsung Gear), however, now make widespread use of VRET in clinical settings and as self-help applications possible. In this literature review, we detail the current state of VR technology and discuss important therapeutic considerations in designing self-help and clinician-led VRETs, such as platform choice, exposure progression design, inhibitory learning strategies, stimuli tailoring, gamification, virtual social learning and more. We illustrate how these therapeutic components can be incorporated and utilized in VRET applications, taking full advantage of the unique capabilities of virtual environments, and showcase some of these features by describing the development of a consumer-ready, gamified self-help VRET application for low-cost commercially available VR hardware. We also raise and discuss challenges in the planning, development, evaluation, and dissemination of VRET applications, including the need for more high-quality research. We conclude by discussing how new technology (e.g. eye-tracking) can be incorporated into future VRETs and how widespread use of VRET self-help applications will enable collection of naturalistic “Big Data” that promises to inform learning theory and behavioral therapy in general.
