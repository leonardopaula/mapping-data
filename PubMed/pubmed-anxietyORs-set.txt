AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on public mental 
      health. Therefore, monitoring and oversight of the population mental health during 
      crises such as a panedmic is an immediate priority. The aim of this study is to 
      analyze the existing research works and findings in relation to the prevalence of 
      stress, anxiety and depression in the general population during the COVID-19 
      pandemic. METHOD: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, articles that have 
      focused on stress and anxiety prevalence among the general population during the 
      COVID-19 pandemic were searched in the Science Direct, Embase, Scopus, PubMed, Web 
      of Science (ISI) and Google Scholar databases, without a lower time limit and until 
      May 2020. In order to perform a meta-analysis of the collected studies, the random 
      effects model was used, and the heterogeneity of studies was investigated using the 
      I(2) index. Moreover. data analysis was conducted using the Comprehensive 
      Meta-Analysis (CMA) software. RESULTS: The prevalence of stress in 5 studies with a 
      total sample size of 9074 is obtained as 29.6% (95% confidence limit: 24.3-35.4), 
      the prevalence of anxiety in 17 studies with a sample size of 63,439 as 31.9% (95% 
      confidence interval: 27.5-36.7), and the prevalence of depression in 14 studies with 
      a sample size of 44,531 people as 33.7% (95% confidence interval: 27.5-40.6). 
      CONCLUSION: COVID-19 not only causes physical health concerns but also results in a 
      number of psychological disorders. The spread of the new coronavirus can impact the 
      mental health of people in different communities. Thus, it is essential to preserve 
      the mental health of individuals and to develop psychological interventions that can 
      improve the mental health of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - Mindfulness on-the-go: Effects of a mindfulness meditation app on work stress and 
      well-being.
PG  - 127-138
LID - 10.1037/ocp0000118 [doi]
AB  - We investigated whether a mindfulness meditation program delivered via a smartphone 
      application could improve psychological well-being, reduce job strain, and reduce 
      ambulatory blood pressure during the workday. Participants were 238 healthy 
      employees from two large United Kingdom companies that were randomized to a 
      mindfulness meditation practice app or a wait-list control condition. The app 
      offered 45 prerecorded 10- to 20-min guided audio meditations. Participants were 
      asked to complete one meditation per day. Psychosocial measures and blood pressure 
      throughout one working day were measured at baseline and eight weeks later; a 
      follow-up survey was also emailed to participants 16 weeks after the intervention 
      start. Usage data showed that during the 8-week intervention period, participants 
      randomized to the intervention completed an average of 17 meditation sessions (range 
      0-45 sessions). The intervention group reported significant improvement in 
      well-being, distress, job strain, and perceptions of workplace social support 
      compared to the control group. In addition, the intervention group had a marginally 
      significant decrease in self-measured workday systolic blood pressure from pre- to 
      post-intervention. Sustained positive effects in the intervention group were found 
      for well-being and job strain at the 16-week follow-up assessment. This trial 
      suggests that short guided mindfulness meditations delivered via smartphone and 
      practiced multiple times per week can improve outcomes related to work stress and 
      well-being, with potentially lasting effects. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019

TI  - Technical and clinical aspects of cortisol as a biochemical marker of chronic 
      stress.
PG  - 209-16
AB  - Stress is now recognized as a universal premorbid factor associated with many risk 
      factors of various chronic diseases. Acute stress may induce an individual's 
      adaptive response to environmental demands. However, chronic, excessive stress 
      causes cumulative negative impacts on health outcomes through "allostatic load". 
      Thus, monitoring the quantified levels of long-term stress mediators would provide a 
      timely opportunity for prevention or earlier intervention of stress-related chronic 
      illnesses. Although either acute or chronic stress could be quantified through 
      measurement of changes in physiological parameters such as heart rate, blood 
      pressure, and levels of various metabolic hormones, it is still elusive to interpret 
      whether the changes in circulating levels of stress mediators such as cortisol can 
      reflect the acute, chronic, or diurnal variations. Both serum and salivary cortisol 
      levels reveal acute changes at a single point in time, but the overall long-term 
      systemic cortisol exposure is difficult to evaluate due to circadian variations and 
      its protein-binding capacity. Scalp hair has a fairy predictable growth rate of 
      approximately 1 cm/month, and the most 1 cm segment approximates the last month's 
      cortisol production as the mean value. The analysis of cortisol in hair is a highly 
      promising technique for the retrospective assessment of chronic stress.

TI  - Physical activity and exercise for chronic pain in adults: an overview of Cochrane 
      Reviews.
PG  - CD011279
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD011279.pub3 [doi]
LID - CD011279
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic pain is defined as pain lasting beyond normal tissue healing 
      time, generally taken to be 12 weeks. It contributes to disability, anxiety, 
      depression, sleep disturbances, poor quality of life, and healthcare costs. Chronic 
      pain has a weighted mean prevalence in adults of 20%.For many years, the treatment 
      choice for chronic pain included recommendations for rest and inactivity. However, 
      exercise may have specific benefits in reducing the severity of chronic pain, as 
      well as more general benefits associated with improved overall physical and mental 
      health, and physical functioning.Physical activity and exercise programmes are 
      increasingly being promoted and offered in various healthcare systems, and for a 
      variety of chronic pain conditions. It is therefore important at this stage to 
      establish the efficacy and safety of these programmes, and furthermore to address 
      the critical factors that determine their success or failure. OBJECTIVES: To provide 
      an overview of Cochrane Reviews of adults with chronic pain to determine (1) the 
      effectiveness of different physical activity and exercise interventions in reducing 
      pain severity and its impact on function, quality of life, and healthcare use; and 
      (2) the evidence for any adverse effects or harm associated with physical activity 
      and exercise interventions. METHODS: We searched theCochrane Database of Systematic 
      Reviews (CDSR) on the Cochrane Library (CDSR 2016, Issue 1) for systematic reviews 
      of randomised controlled trials (RCTs), after which we tracked any included reviews 
      for updates, and tracked protocols in case of full review publication until an 
      arbitrary cut-off date of 21 March 2016 (CDSR 2016, Issue 3). We assessed the 
      methodological quality of the reviews using the AMSTAR tool, and also planned to 
      analyse data for each painful condition based on quality of the evidence.We 
      extracted data for (1) self-reported pain severity, (2) physical function 
      (objectively or subjectively measured), (3) psychological function, (4) quality of 
      life, (5) adherence to the prescribed intervention, (6) healthcare use/attendance, 
      (7) adverse events, and (8) death.Due to the limited data available, we were unable 
      to directly compare and analyse interventions, and have instead reported the 
      evidence qualitatively. MAIN RESULTS: We included 21 reviews with 381 included 
      studies and 37,143 participants. Of these, 264 studies (19,642 participants) 
      examined exercise versus no exercise/minimal intervention in adults with chronic 
      pain and were used in the qualitative analysis.Pain conditions included rheumatoid 
      arthritis, osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, low back pain, intermittent claudication, 
      dysmenorrhoea, mechanical neck disorder, spinal cord injury, postpolio syndrome, and 
      patellofemoral pain. None of the reviews assessed 'chronic pain' or 'chronic 
      widespread pain' as a general term or specific condition. Interventions included 
      aerobic, strength, flexibility, range of motion, and core or balance training 
      programmes, as well as yoga, Pilates, and tai chi.Reviews were well performed and 
      reported (based on AMSTAR), and included studies had acceptable risk of bias (with 
      inadequate reporting of attrition and reporting biases). However the quality of 
      evidence was low due to participant numbers (most included studies had fewer than 50 
      participants in total), length of intervention and follow-up (rarely assessed beyond 
      three to six months). We pooled the results from relevant reviews where appropriate, 
      though results should be interpreted with caution due to the low quality evidence. 
      Pain severity: several reviews noted favourable results from exercise: only three 
      reviews that reported pain severity found no statistically significant changes in 
      usual or mean pain from any intervention. However, results were inconsistent across 
      interventions and follow-up, as exercise did not consistently bring about a change 
      (positive or negative) in self-reported pain scores at any single point. Physical 
      function: was the most commonly reported outcome measure. Physical function was 
      significantly improved as a result of the intervention in 14 reviews, though even 
      these statistically significant results had only small-to-moderate effect sizes 
      (only one review reported large effect sizes). Psychological function and quality of 
      life: had variable results: results were either favourable to exercise (generally 
      small and moderate effect size, with two reviews reporting significant, large effect 
      sizes for quality of life), or showed no difference between groups. There were no 
      negative effects. Adherence to the prescribed intervention: could not be assessed in 
      any review. However, risk of withdrawal/dropout was slightly higher in the 
      exercising group (82.8/1000 participants versus 81/1000 participants), though the 
      group difference was non-significant. Healthcare use/attendance: was not reported in 
      any review. Adverse events, potential harm, and death: only 25% of included studies 
      (across 18 reviews) actively reported adverse events. Based on the available 
      evidence, most adverse events were increased soreness or muscle pain, which 
      reportedly subsided after a few weeks of the intervention. Only one review reported 
      death separately to other adverse events: the intervention was protective against 
      death (based on the available evidence), though did not reach statistical 
      significance. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The quality of the evidence examining physical 
      activity and exercise for chronic pain is low. This is largely due to small sample 
      sizes and potentially underpowered studies. A number of studies had adequately long 
      interventions, but planned follow-up was limited to less than one year in all but 
      six reviews.There were some favourable effects in reduction in pain severity and 
      improved physical function, though these were mostly of small-to-moderate effect, 
      and were not consistent across the reviews. There were variable effects for 
      psychological function and quality of life.The available evidence suggests physical 
      activity and exercise is an intervention with few adverse events that may improve 
      pain severity and physical function, and consequent quality of life. However, 
      further research is required and should focus on increasing participant numbers, 
      including participants with a broader spectrum of pain severity, and lengthening 
      both the intervention itself, and the follow-up period.

TI  - The digital revolution and its impact on mental health care.

AB  - The digital revolution is evolving at an unstoppable pace. Alongside the 
      unprecedented explosion of digital technology facilities and systems, mental health 
      care is under greater pressure than ever before. With its emphasis on big data, 
      computing power, mobile technology, and network information, digital technology is 
      set to transform health care delivery. This article reviews the field of digital 
      health technology assessment and intervention primarily in secondary service mental 
      health care, including the barriers and facilitators to adopting and implementing 
      digitally mediated interventions in service delivery. We consider the impact of 
      digitally mediated communication on human interaction and its potential impact on 
      various mental states such as those linked to mood, anxiety but also well-being. 
      These developments point to a need for both theory- and data-driven approaches to 
      digital health care. We argue that, as developments in digital technology are 
      outpacing the evaluation of rigorous digital health interventions, more advanced 
      methodologies are needed to keep up with the pace of digital technology development. 
      The need for co-production of digital tools with and for people with chronic and 
      mental health difficulties, and implications of digital technology for psychotherapy 
      practice, will be central to this development. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Mental health 
      problems are one of the main causes of global and societal burden and are a growing 
      public health. People with mental health problems around the world have limited, if 
      any, chance of accessing psychological help at all. Technological innovations and 
      solutions are being considered in an attempt to address the size and scale of the 
      mental health crisis worldwide. Digital platforms allow people to self-monitor and 
      self-manage in a way that face-to-face/paper-based methods of assessment have up 
      until now not allowed. We provide examples of digital tools that are being developed 
      and used in the secondary setting and identify a number of challenges in the digital 
      health field that require careful consideration.

TI  - Physical activity and exercise for chronic pain in adults: an overview of Cochrane 
      Reviews.
PG  - CD011279

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic pain is defined as pain lasting beyond normal tissue healing 
      time, generally taken to be 12 weeks. It contributes to disability, anxiety, 
      depression, sleep disturbances, poor quality of life, and healthcare costs. Chronic 
      pain has a weighted mean prevalence in adults of 20%.For many years, the treatment 
      choice for chronic pain included recommendations for rest and inactivity. However, 
      exercise may have specific benefits in reducing the severity of chronic pain, as 
      well as more general benefits associated with improved overall physical and mental 
      health, and physical functioning.Physical activity and exercise programmes are 
      increasingly being promoted and offered in various healthcare systems, and for a 
      variety of chronic pain conditions. It is therefore important at this stage to 
      establish the efficacy and safety of these programmes, and furthermore to address 
      the critical factors that determine their success or failure. OBJECTIVES: To provide 
      an overview of Cochrane Reviews of adults with chronic pain to determine (1) the 
      effectiveness of different physical activity and exercise interventions in reducing 
      pain severity and its impact on function, quality of life, and healthcare use; and 
      (2) the evidence for any adverse effects or harm associated with physical activity 
      and exercise interventions. METHODS: We searched theCochrane Database of Systematic 
      Reviews (CDSR) on the Cochrane Library (CDSR 2016, Issue 1) for systematic reviews 
      of randomised controlled trials (RCTs), after which we tracked any included reviews 
      for updates, and tracked protocols in case of full review publication until an 
      arbitrary cut-off date of 21 March 2016 (CDSR 2016, Issue 3). We assessed the 
      methodological quality of the reviews using the AMSTAR tool, and also planned to 
      analyse data for each painful condition based on quality of the evidence.We 
      extracted data for (1) self-reported pain severity, (2) physical function 
      (objectively or subjectively measured), (3) psychological function, (4) quality of 
      life, (5) adherence to the prescribed intervention, (6) healthcare use/attendance, 
      (7) adverse events, and (8) death.Due to the limited data available, we were unable 
      to directly compare and analyse interventions, and have instead reported the 
      evidence qualitatively. MAIN RESULTS: We included 21 reviews with 381 included 
      studies and 37,143 participants. Of these, 264 studies (19,642 participants) 
      examined exercise versus no exercise/minimal intervention in adults with chronic 
      pain and were used in the qualitative analysis.Pain conditions included rheumatoid 
      arthritis, osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, low back pain, intermittent claudication, 
      dysmenorrhoea, mechanical neck disorder, spinal cord injury, postpolio syndrome, and 
      patellofemoral pain. None of the reviews assessed 'chronic pain' or 'chronic 
      widespread pain' as a general term or specific condition. Interventions included 
      aerobic, strength, flexibility, range of motion, and core or balance training 
      programmes, as well as yoga, Pilates, and tai chi.Reviews were well performed and 
      reported (based on AMSTAR), and included studies had acceptable risk of bias (with 
      inadequate reporting of attrition and reporting biases). However the quality of 
      evidence was low due to participant numbers (most included studies had fewer than 50 
      participants in total), length of intervention and follow-up (rarely assessed beyond 
      three to six months). We pooled the results from relevant reviews where appropriate, 
      though results should be interpreted with caution due to the low quality evidence. 
      Pain severity: several reviews noted favourable results from exercise: only three 
      reviews that reported pain severity found no statistically significant changes in 
      usual or mean pain from any intervention. However, results were inconsistent across 
      interventions and follow-up, as exercise did not consistently bring about a change 
      (positive or negative) in self-reported pain scores at any single point. Physical 
      function: was the most commonly reported outcome measure. Physical function was 
      significantly improved as a result of the intervention in 14 reviews, though even 
      these statistically significant results had only small-to-moderate effect sizes 
      (only one review reported large effect sizes). Psychological function and quality of 
      life: had variable results: results were either favourable to exercise (generally 
      small and moderate effect size, with two reviews reporting significant, large effect 
      sizes for quality of life), or showed no difference between groups. There were no 
      negative effects. Adherence to the prescribed intervention: could not be assessed in 
      any review. However, risk of withdrawal/dropout was slightly higher in the 
      exercising group (82.8/1000 participants versus 81/1000 participants), though the 
      group difference was non-significant. Healthcare use/attendance: was not reported in 
      any review. Adverse events, potential harm, and death: only 25% of included studies 
      (across 18 reviews) actively reported adverse events. Based on the available 
      evidence, most adverse events were increased soreness or muscle pain, which 
      reportedly subsided after a few weeks of the intervention. Only one review reported 
      death separately to other adverse events: the intervention was protective against 
      death (based on the available evidence), though did not reach statistical 
      significance. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The quality of the evidence examining physical 
      activity and exercise for chronic pain is low. This is largely due to small sample 
      sizes and potentially underpowered studies. A number of studies had adequately long 
      interventions, but planned follow-up was limited to less than one year in all but 
      six reviews.There were some favourable effects in reduction in pain severity and 
      improved physical function, though these were mostly of small-to-moderate effect, 
      and were not consistent across the reviews. There were variable effects for 
      psychological function and quality of life.The available evidence suggests physical 
      activity and exercise is an intervention with few adverse events that may improve 
      pain severity and physical function, and consequent quality of life. However, 
      further research is required and should focus on increasing participant numbers, 
      including participants with a broader spectrum of pain severity, and lengthening 
      both the intervention itself, and the follow-up period.

      Distancing With COVID-19.

AB  - The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has spread rapidly throughout the world 
      and has had a long-term impact. The pandemic has caused great harm to society and 
      caused serious psychological trauma to many people. Children are a vulnerable group 
      in this global public health emergency, as their nervous systems, endocrine systems, 
      and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axes are not well developed. Psychological crises 
      often cause children to produce feelings of abandonment, despair, incapacity, and 
      exhaustion, and even raise the risk of suicide. Children with mental illnesses are 
      especially vulnerable during the quarantine and social distancing period. The 
      inclusion of psychosocial support for children and their families are part of the 
      health responses to disaster and disaster recovery. Based on the biopsychosocial 
      model, some children may have catastrophic thoughts and be prone to experience 
      despair, numbness, flashbacks, and other serious emotional and behavioral reactions. 
      In severe cases, there may be symptoms of psychosis or posttraumatic stress 
      disorder. Timely and appropriate protections are needed to prevent the occurrence of 
      psychological and behavioral problems. The emerging digital applications and health 
      services such as telehealth, social media, mobile health, and remote interactive 
      online education are able to bridge the social distance and support mental and 
      behavioral health for children. Based on the psychological development 
      characteristics of children, this study also illustrates interventions on the 
      psychological impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. Even though the world has been 
      struggling to curb the influences of the pandemic, the quarantine and social 
      distancing policies will have long-term impacts on children. Innovative digital 
      solutions and informatics tools are needed more than ever to mitigate the negative 
      consequences on children. Health care delivery and services should envision and 
      implement innovative paradigms to meet broad well-being needs and child health as 
      the quarantine and social distancing over a longer term becomes a new reality. 
      Future research on children's mental and behavioral health should pay more attention 
      to novel solutions that incorporate cutting edge interactive technologies and 
      digital approaches, leveraging considerable advances in pervasive and ubiquitous 
      computing, human-computer interaction, and health informatics among many others. 
      Digital approaches, health technologies, and informatics are supposed to be designed 
      and implemented to support public health surveillance and critical responses to 
      children's growth and development. For instance, human-computer interactions, 
      augmented reality, and virtual reality could be incorporated to remote psychological 
      supporting service for children's health; mobile technologies could be used to 
      monitor children's mental and behavioral health while protecting their individual 
      privacy; big data and artificial intelligence could be used to support decision 
      making on whether children should go out for physical activities and whether schools 
      should be reopened. Implications to clinical practices, psychological therapeutic 
      practices, and future research directions to address current effort gaps are 
      highlighted in this study.

TI  - What is resilience? An Integrative Review of the empirical literature.
PG  - 980-1000
LID - 10.1111/jan.12888 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To use systematic methods to examine how resilience is defined in empirical 
      research. BACKGROUND: Resilience is a term that is increasingly being used to 
      describe and explain the complexities of individual and group responses to traumatic 
      and challenging situations. It is now frequently mentioned in relation to many areas 
      of nursing practice, including research. Given the increasing use of the term, it is 
      timely to examine how resilience has been defined in empirical research. DESIGN: An 
      integrative review of the empirical literature (2000-2015). DATA SOURCES: Three 
      health-related databases were searched: Medline, PsycINFO and the Cumulative Index 
      for Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL). Reference and citation tracking was 
      performed on all articles included in the review. REVIEW METHODS: The methods 
      described by Whittemore and Knafl were used to guide this review. Two reviewers were 
      involved in screening articles for inclusion and in the data extraction process. 
      Data were synthesized using the constant comparative method of analysis. RESULTS: 
      One hundred articles were included in the final data analysis. The most significant 
      finding of the review was that there is no universal definition of resilience. There 
      were, however, some common themes identified: rising above, adaptation and 
      adjustment, dynamic process, 'ordinary magic' and mental illness as a marker of 
      resilience. CONCLUSION: Despite the increasing use of the term 'resilience', this 
      review has identified that there is no universal definition of resilience adopted in 
      the research literature. Further research is required to explore this construct in 
      the context of nursing.

TI  - Current and evolving standards of care for patients with ARDS.
PG  - 2157-2167
LID - 10.1007/s00134-020-06299-6 [doi]
AB  - Care for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has changed 
      considerably over the 50 years since its original description. Indeed, standards of 
      care continue to evolve as does how this clinical entity is defined and how patients 
      are grouped and treated in clinical practice. In this narrative review we discuss 
      current standards - treatments that have a solid evidence base and are well 
      established as targets for usual care - and also evolving standards - treatments 
      that have promise and may become widely adopted in the future. We focus on three 
      broad domains of ventilatory management, ventilation adjuncts, and pharmacotherapy. 
      Current standards for ventilatory management include limitation of tidal volume and 
      airway pressure and standard approaches to setting PEEP, while evolving standards 
      might focus on limitation of driving pressure or mechanical power, individual 
      titration of PEEP, and monitoring efforts during spontaneous breathing. Current 
      standards in ventilation adjuncts include prone positioning in moderate-severe ARDS 
      and veno-venous extracorporeal life support after prone positioning in patients with 
      severe hypoxemia or who are difficult to ventilate. Pharmacotherapy current 
      standards include corticosteroids for patients with ARDS due to COVID-19 and 
      employing a conservative fluid strategy for patients not in shock; evolving 
      standards may include steroids for ARDS not related to COVID-19, or specific 
      biological agents being tested in appropriate sub-phenotypes of ARDS. While much 
      progress has been made, certainly significant work remains to be done and we look 
      forward to these future developments.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disorder that causes abnormal 
      blood glucose (BG) regulation that might result in short and long-term health 
      complications and even death if not properly managed. Currently, there is no cure 
      for diabetes. However, self-management of the disease, especially keeping BG in the 
      recommended range, is central to the treatment. This includes actively tracking BG 
      levels and managing physical activity, diet, and insulin intake. The recent 
      advancements in diabetes technologies and self-management applications have made it 
      easier for patients to have more access to relevant data. In this regard, the 
      development of an artificial pancreas (a closed-loop system), personalized decision 
      systems, and BG event alarms are becoming more apparent than ever. Techniques such 
      as predicting BG (modeling of a personalized profile), and modeling BG dynamics are 
      central to the development of these diabetes management technologies. The increased 
      availability of sufficient patient historical data has paved the way for the 
      introduction of machine learning and its application for intelligent and improved 
      systems for diabetes management. The capability of machine learning to solve complex 
      tasks with dynamic environment and knowledge has contributed to its success in 
      diabetes research. MOTIVATION: Recently, machine learning and data mining have 
      become popular, with their expanding application in diabetes research and within BG 
      prediction services in particular. Despite the increasing and expanding popularity 
      of machine learning applications in BG prediction services, updated reviews that map 
      and materialize the current trends in modeling options and strategies are lacking 
      within the context of BG prediction (modeling of personalized profile) in type 1 
      diabetes. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review is to develop a compact guide 
      regarding modeling options and strategies of machine learning and a hybrid system 
      focusing on the prediction of BG dynamics in type 1 diabetes. The review covers 
      machine learning approaches pertinent to the controller of an artificial pancreas 
      (closed-loop systems), modeling of personalized profiles, personalized decision 
      support systems, and BG alarm event applications. Generally, the review will 
      identify, assess, analyze, and discuss the current trends of machine learning 
      applications within these contexts. METHOD: A rigorous literature review was 
      conducted between August 2017 and February 2018 through various online databases, 
      including Google Scholar, PubMed, ScienceDirect, and others. Additionally, 
      peer-reviewed journals and articles were considered. Relevant studies were first 
      identified by reviewing the title, keywords, and abstracts as preliminary filters 
      with our selection criteria, and then we reviewed the full texts of the articles 
      that were found relevant. Information from the selected literature was extracted 
      based on predefined categories, which were based on previous research and further 
      elaborated through brainstorming among the authors. RESULTS: The initial search was 
      done by analyzing the title, abstract, and keywords. A total of 624 papers were 
      retrieved from DBLP Computer Science (25), Diabetes Technology and Therapeutics 
      (31), Google Scholar (193), IEEE (267), Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology 
      (31), PubMed/Medline (27), and ScienceDirect (50). After removing duplicates from 
      the list, 417 records remained. Then, we independently assessed and screened the 
      articles based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, which eliminated another 204 
      papers, leaving 213 relevant papers. After a full-text assessment, 55 articles were 
      left, which were critically analyzed. The inter-rater agreement was measured using a 
      Cohen Kappa test, and disagreements were resolved through discussion. CONCLUSION: 
      Due to the complexity of BG dynamics, it remains difficult to achieve a universal 
      model that produces an accurate prediction in every circumstance (i.e., 
      hypo/eu/hyperglycemia events). Recently, machine learning techniques have received 
      wider attention and increased popularity in diabetes research in general and BG 
      prediction in particular, coupled with the ever-growing availability of a 
      self-collected health data. The state-of-the-art demonstrates that various machine 
      learning techniques have been tested to predict BG, such as recurrent neural 
      networks, feed-forward neural networks, support vector machines, self-organizing 
      maps, the Gaussian process, genetic algorithm and programs, deep neural networks, 
      and others, using various group of input parameters and training algorithms. The 
      main limitation of the current approaches is the lack of a well-defined approach to 
      estimate carbohydrate intake, which is mainly done manually by individual users and 
      is prone to an error that can severely affect the predictive performance. Moreover, 
      a universal approach has not been established to estimate and quantify the 
      approximate effect of physical activities, stress, and infections on the BG level. 
      No researchers have assessed model predictive performance during stress and 
      infection incidences in a free-living condition, which should be considered in 
      future studies. Furthermore, a little has been done regarding model portability that 
      can capture inter- and intra-variability among patients. It seems that the effect of 
      time lags between the CGM readings and the actual BG levels is not well covered. 
      However, in general, we foresee that these developments might foster the advancement 
      of next-generation BG prediction algorithms, which will make a great contribution in 
      the effort to develop the long-awaited, so-called artificial pancreas (a closed-loop 
      system).

AB  - Blood test data were traditionally confined to the clinic for diagnostic purposes, 
      but are now becoming more routinely used in many professional and elite 
      high-performance settings as a physiological profiling and monitoring tool. A wealth 
      of information based on robust research evidence can be gleaned from blood tests, 
      including: the identification of iron, vitamin or energy deficiency; the 
      identification of oxidative stress and inflammation; and the status of red blood 
      cell populations. Serial blood test data can be used to monitor athletes and make 
      inferences about the efficacy of training interventions, nutritional strategies or 
      indeed the capacity to tolerate training load. Via a profiling and monitoring 
      approach, blood biomarker measurement combined with contextual data has the 
      potential to help athletes avoid injury and illness via adjustments to diet, 
      training load and recovery strategies. Since wide inter-individual variability 
      exists in many biomarkers, clinical population-based reference data can be of 
      limited value in athletes, and statistical methods for longitudinal data are 
      required to identify meaningful changes within an athlete. Data quality is often 
      compromised by poor pre-analytic controls in sport settings. The biotechnology 
      industry is rapidly evolving, providing new technologies and methods, some of which 
      may be well suited to athlete applications in the future. This review provides 
      current perspectives, limitations and recommendations for sports science and sports 
      medicine practitioners using blood profiling and monitoring for nutrition and 
      performance purposes.

TI  - Patient-ventilator asynchronies during mechanical ventilation: current knowledge and 
      research priorities.
PG  - 43

LID - 43
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mechanical ventilation is common in critically ill patients. This 
      life-saving treatment can cause complications and is also associated with long-term 
      sequelae. Patient-ventilator asynchronies are frequent but underdiagnosed, and they 
      have been associated with worse outcomes. MAIN BODY: Asynchronies occur when 
      ventilator assistance does not match the patient's demand. Ventilatory 
      overassistance or underassistance translates to different types of asynchronies with 
      different effects on patients. Underassistance can result in an excessive load on 
      respiratory muscles, air hunger, or lung injury due to excessive tidal volumes. 
      Overassistance can result in lower patient inspiratory drive and can lead to reverse 
      triggering, which can also worsen lung injury. Identifying the type of asynchrony 
      and its causes is crucial for effective treatment. Mechanical ventilation and 
      asynchronies can affect hemodynamics. An increase in intrathoracic pressure during 
      ventilation modifies ventricular preload and afterload of ventricles, thereby 
      affecting cardiac output and hemodynamic status. Ineffective efforts can decrease 
      intrathoracic pressure, but double cycling can increase it. Thus, asynchronies can 
      lower the predictive accuracy of some hemodynamic parameters of fluid 
      responsiveness. New research is also exploring the psychological effects of 
      asynchronies. Anxiety and depression are common in survivors of critical illness 
      long after discharge. Patients on mechanical ventilation feel anxiety, fear, agony, 
      and insecurity, which can worsen in the presence of asynchronies. Asynchronies have 
      been associated with worse overall prognosis, but the direct causal relation between 
      poor patient-ventilator interaction and worse outcomes has yet to be clearly 
      demonstrated. Critical care patients generate huge volumes of data that are vastly 
      underexploited. New monitoring systems can analyze waveforms together with other 
      inputs, helping us to detect, analyze, and even predict asynchronies. Big data 
      approaches promise to help us understand asynchronies better and improve their 
      diagnosis and management. CONCLUSIONS: Although our understanding of asynchronies 
      has increased in recent years, many questions remain to be answered. Evolving 
      concepts in asynchronies, lung crosstalk with other organs, and the difficulties of 
      data management make more efforts necessary in this field.

AB  - Interventional pharmacology is one of medicine's most potent weapons against 
      disease. These drugs, however, can result in damaging side effects and must be 
      closely monitored. Pharmacovigilance is the field of science that monitors, detects, 
      and prevents adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Safety efforts begin during the 
      development process, using in vivo and in vitro studies, continue through clinical 
      trials, and extend to postmarketing surveillance of ADRs in real-world populations. 
      Future toxicity and safety challenges, including increased polypharmacy and patient 
      diversity, stress the limits of these traditional tools. Massive amounts of newly 
      available data present an opportunity for using artificial intelligence (AI) and 
      machine learning to improve drug safety science. Here, we explore recent advances as 
      applied to preclinical drug safety and postmarketing surveillance with a specific 
      focus on machine and deep learning (DL) approaches.

AB  - With the evolution of diabetes technology, those living with Type 1 diabetes are 
      given a wider arsenal of tools with which to achieve glycaemic control and improve 
      patient-reported outcomes. Furthermore, the use of these technologies may help 
      reduce the risk of acute complications, such as severe hypoglycaemia and diabetic 
      ketoacidosis, as well as long-term macro- and microvascular complications. In 
      addition, diabetes technology can have a beneficial impact on psychosocial health by 
      reducing the burden of diabetes. Unfortunately, diabetes goals are often unmet and 
      people with Type 1 diabetes too frequently experience acute and long-term 
      complications of this condition, in addition to often having less than ideal 
      psychosocial outcomes. Increasing realization of the importance of patient-reported 
      outcomes is leading to diabetes care delivery becoming more patient-centred. 
      Diabetes technology in the form of medical devices, digital health and big data 
      analytics have the potential to improve clinical care and psychosocial support, 
      resulting in lower rates of acute and chronic complications, decreased burden of 
      diabetes care, and improved quality of life.

AB  - Serotonin plays a central role in cognition and is the target of most 
      pharmaceuticals for psychiatric disorders. Existing drugs have limited efficacy; 
      creation of improved versions will require better understanding of serotonergic 
      circuitry, which has been hampered by our inability to monitor serotonin release and 
      transport with high spatial and temporal resolution. We developed and applied a 
      binding-pocket redesign strategy, guided by machine learning, to create a 
      high-performance, soluble, fluorescent serotonin sensor (iSeroSnFR), enabling 
      optical detection of millisecond-scale serotonin transients. We demonstrate that 
      iSeroSnFR can be used to detect serotonin release in freely behaving mice during 
      fear conditioning, social interaction, and sleep/wake transitions. We also developed 
      a robust assay of serotonin transporter function and modulation by drugs. We expect 
      that both machine-learning-guided binding-pocket redesign and iSeroSnFR will have 
      broad utility for the development of other sensors and in vitro and in vivo 
      serotonin detection, respectively.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Wearable sensors (wearables) have been commonly integrated into a wide 
      variety of commercial products and are increasingly being used to collect and 
      process raw physiological parameters into salient digital health information. The 
      data collected by wearables are currently being investigated across a broad set of 
      clinical domains and patient populations. There is significant research occurring in 
      the domain of algorithm development, with the aim of translating raw sensor data 
      into fitness- or health-related outcomes of interest for users, patients, and health 
      care providers. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this review is to highlight a selected group 
      of fitness- and health-related indicators from wearables data and to describe 
      several algorithmic approaches used to generate these higher order indicators. 
      METHODS: A systematic search of the Pubmed database was performed with the following 
      search terms (number of records in parentheses): Fitbit algorithm (18), Apple Watch 
      algorithm (3), Garmin algorithm (5), Microsoft Band algorithm (8), Samsung Gear 
      algorithm (2), Xiaomi MiBand algorithm (1), Huawei Band (Watch) algorithm (2), 
      photoplethysmography algorithm (465), accelerometry algorithm (966), ECG algorithm 
      (8287), continuous glucose monitor algorithm (343). The search terms chosen for this 
      review are focused on algorithms for wearable devices that dominated the commercial 
      wearables market between 2014-2017 and that were highly represented in the 
      biomedical literature. A second set of search terms included categories of 
      algorithms for fitness-related and health-related indicators that are commonly used 
      in wearable devices (e.g. accelerometry, PPG, ECG). These papers covered the 
      following domain areas: fitness; exercise; movement; physical activity; step count; 
      walking; running; swimming; energy expenditure; atrial fibrillation; arrhythmia; 
      cardiovascular; autonomic nervous system; neuropathy; heart rate variability; fall 
      detection; trauma; behavior change; diet; eating; stress detection; serum glucose 
      monitoring; continuous glucose monitoring; diabetes mellitus type 1; diabetes 
      mellitus type 2. All studies uncovered through this search on commercially available 
      device algorithms and pivotal studies on sensor algorithm development were 
      summarized, and a summary table was constructed using references generated by the 
      literature review as described (Table 1). CONCLUSIONS: Wearable health technologies 
      aim to collect and process raw physiological or environmental parameters into 
      salient digital health information. Much of the current and future utility of 
      wearables lies in the signal processing steps and algorithms used to analyze large 
      volumes of data. Continued algorithmic development and advances in machine learning

TI  - Real-time Mobile Monitoring of the Dynamic Associations Among Motor Activity, 
      Energy, Mood, and Sleep in Adults With Bipolar Disorder.
PG  - 190-198
LID - 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2018.3546 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Biologic systems involved in the regulation of motor activity are 
      intricately linked with other homeostatic systems such as sleep, feeding behavior, 
      energy, and mood. Mobile monitoring technology (eg, actigraphy and ecological 
      momentary assessment devices) allows the assessment of these multiple systems in 
      real time. However, most clinical studies of mental disorders that use mobile 
      devices have not focused on the dynamic associations between these systems. 
      OBJECTIVES: To examine the directional associations among motor activity, energy, 
      mood, and sleep using mobile monitoring in a community-identified sample, and to 
      evaluate whether these within-day associations differ between people with a history 
      of bipolar or other mood disorders and controls without mood disorders. DESIGN, 
      SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study used a nested case-control design of 242 
      adults, a subsample of a community-based sample of adults. Probands were recruited 
      by mail from the greater Washington, DC, metropolitan area from January 2005 to June 
      2013. Enrichment of the sample for mood disorders was provided by volunteers or 
      referrals from the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center or by participants 
      in the National Institute of Mental Health Mood and Anxiety Disorders Program. The 
      inclusion criteria were the ability to speak English, availability to participate, 
      and consent to contact at least 2 living first-degree relatives. Data analysis was 
      performed from June 2013 through July 2018. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Motor 
      activity and sleep duration data were obtained from minute-to-minute activity counts 
      from an actigraphy device worn on the nondominant wrist for 2 weeks. Mood and energy 
      levels were assessed by subjective analogue ratings on the ecological momentary 
      assessment (using a personal digital assistant) by participants 4 times per day for 
      2 weeks. RESULTS: Of the total 242 participants, 92 (38.1%) were men and 150 (61.9%) 
      were women, with a mean (SD) age of 48 (16.9) years. Among the participants, 54 
      (22.3%) had bipolar disorder (25 with bipolar I; 29 with bipolar II), 91 (37.6%) had 
      major depressive disorder, and 97 (40.1%) were controls with no history of mood 
      disorders. A unidirectional association was found between motor activity and 
      subjective mood level (β = -0.018, P = .04). Bidirectional associations were 
      observed between motor activity (β = 0.176; P = .03) and subjective energy level 
      (β = 0.027; P = .03) as well as between motor activity (β = -0.027; P = .04) and 
      sleep duration (β = -0.154; P = .04). Greater cross-domain reactivity was observed 
      in bipolar disorder across all outcomes, including motor activity, sleep, mood, and 
      energy. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that interventions focused 
      on motor activity and energy may have greater efficacy than current approaches that 
      target depressed mood; both active and passive tracking of multiple regulatory 
      systems are important in designing therapeutic targets.

TI  - Reappraisal of Ventilator-Free Days in Critical Care Research.
PG  - 828-836
LID - 10.1164/rccm.201810-2050CP [doi]
AB  - Ventilator-free days (VFDs) are a commonly reported composite outcome measure in 
      acute respiratory distress syndrome trials. VFDs combine survival and duration of 
      ventilation in a manner that summarizes the "net effect" of an intervention on these 
      two outcomes. However, this combining of outcome measures makes VFDs difficult to 
      understand and analyze, which contributes to imprecise interpretations. We discuss 
      the strengths and limitations of VFDs and other "failure-free day" composites, and 
      we provide a framework for when and how to use these outcome measures. We also 
      provide a comprehensive discussion of the different analytic methods for analyzing 
      and interpreting VFDs, including Student's t tests and rank-sum tests, as well as 
      competing risk regressions treating extubation as the primary outcome and death as 
      the competing risk. Using simulations, we illustrate how the statistical test with 
      optimal power depends on the relative contributions of mortality and ventilator 
      duration on the composite effect size. Finally, we recommend a simple analysis and 
      reporting framework using the competing risk approach, which provides clear 
      information on the effect size of an intervention, a statistical test and measure of 
      confidence with the ability to adjust for baseline factors and allow interim 
      monitoring for trials. We emphasize that any approach to analyzing a composite 
      outcome, including other "failure-free day" constructs, should also be accompanied 
      by an examination of the components.

TI  - Intermittent auscultation (IA) of fetal heart rate in labour for fetal well-being.
PG  - CD008680
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD008680.pub2 [doi]
LID - CD008680
AB  - BACKGROUND: The goal of fetal monitoring in labour is the early detection of a 
      hypoxic baby. There are a variety of tools and methods available for intermittent 
      auscultation (IA) of the fetal heart rate (FHR). Low- and middle-income countries 
      usually have only access to a Pinard/Laënnec or the use of a hand-held Doppler 
      device. Currently, there is no robust evidence to guide clinical practice on the 
      most effective IA tool to use, timing intervals and length of listening to the fetal 
      heart for women during established labour. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness 
      of different tools for IA of the fetal heart rate during labour including frequency 
      and duration of auscultation. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and 
      Childbirth Group's Trials Register (19 September 2016), contacted experts and 
      searched reference lists of retrieved articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: All published 
      and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or cluster-RCTs comparing 
      different tools and methods used for intermittent fetal auscultation during labour 
      for fetal and maternal well-being. Quasi-RCTs, and cross-over designs were not 
      eligible for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: All review authors 
      independently assessed eligibility, extracted data and assessed risk of bias for 
      each trial. Data were checked for accuracy. MAIN RESULTS: We included three studies 
      (6241 women and 6241 babies), but only two studies are included in the meta-analyses 
      (3242 women and 3242 babies). Both were judged as high risk for performance bias due 
      to the inability to blind the participants and healthcare providers to the 
      interventions. Evidence was graded as moderate to very low quality; the main reasons 
      for downgrading were study design limitations and imprecision of effect estimates. 
      Intermittent Electronic Fetal Monitoring (EFM) using Cardiotocography (CTG) with 
      routine Pinard (one trial)There was no clear difference between groups in low Apgar 
      scores at five minutes (reported as < six at five minutes after birth) (risk ratio 
      (RR) 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.24 to 1.83, 633 babies, very low-quality 
      evidence). There were no clear differences for perinatal mortality (RR 0.88, 95% CI 
      0.34 to 2.25; 633 infants, very low-quality evidence). Neonatal seizures were 
      reduced in the EFM group (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.89; 633 infants, very 
      low-quality evidence). Other important infant outcomes were not reported: mortality 
      or serious morbidity (composite outcome), cerebral palsy or neurosensory disability. 
      For maternal outcomes, women allocated to intermittent electronic fetal monitoring 
      (EFM) (CTG) had higher rates of caesarean section for fetal distress (RR 2.92, 95% 
      CI 1.78 to 4.80, 633 women, moderate-quality evidence) compared with women allocated 
      to routine Pinard. There was no clear difference between groups in instrumental 
      vaginal births (RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.86 to 2.49, low-quality evidence). Other outcomes 
      were not reported (maternal mortality, instrumental vaginal birth for fetal distress 
      and or acidosis, analgesia in labour, mobility or restriction during labour, and 
      postnatal depression). Doppler ultrasonography with routine Pinard (two trials)There 
      was no clear difference between groups in Apgar scores < seven at five minutes after 
      birth (reported as < six in one of the trials) (average RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.20 to 
      2.87; two trials, 2598 babies, I(2) = 72%, very low-quality evidence); there was 
      high heterogeneity for this outcome. There was no clear difference between groups 
      for perinatal mortality (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.09 to 5.40; 2597 infants, two studies, 
      very low-quality evidence), or neonatal seizures (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.91; 627 
      infants, one study, very low-quality evidence). Other important infant outcomes were 
      not reported (cord blood acidosis, composite of mortality and serious morbidity, 
      cerebral palsy, neurosensory disability). Only one study reported maternal outcomes. 
      Women allocated to Doppler ultrasonography had higher rates of caesarean section for 
      fetal distress compared with those allocated to routine Pinard (RR 2.71, 95% CI 1.64 
      to 4.48, 627 women, moderate-quality evidence). There was no clear difference in 
      instrumental vaginal births between groups (RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.32, 627 women, 
      low-quality evidence). Other maternal outcomes were not reported. Intensive Pinard 
      versus routine Pinard (one trial)One trial compared intensive Pinard (a research 
      midwife following the protocol in a one-to-one care situation) with routine Pinard 
      (as per protocol but midwife may be caring for more than one woman in labour). There 
      was no clear difference between groups in low Apgar score (reported as < six this 
      trial) (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.35 to 2.31, 625 babies, very low-quality evidence). There 
      were also no clear differences identified for perinatal mortality (RR 0.56, 95% CI 
      0.19 to 1.67; 625 infants, very low-quality evidence), or neonatal seizures (RR 
      0.68, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.88, 625 infants, very low-quality evidence)). Other infant 
      outcomes were not reported. For maternal outcomes, there were no clear differences 
      between groups for caesarean section or instrumental delivery (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.35 
      to 1.38, and RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.69 to 2.11, respectively, 625 women, both low-quality 
      evidence)) Other outcomes were not reported. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Using a hand-held 
      (battery and wind-up) Doppler and intermittent CTG with an abdominal transducer 
      without paper tracing for IA in labour was associated with an increase in caesarean 
      sections due to fetal distress. There was no clear difference in neonatal outcomes 
      (low Apgar scores at five minutes after birth, neonatal seizures or perinatal 
      mortality). Long-term outcomes for the baby (including neurodevelopmental disability 
      and cerebral palsy) were not reported. The quality of the evidence was assessed as 
      moderate to very low and several important outcomes were not reported which means 
      that uncertainty remains regarding the use of IA of FHR in labour.As intermittent 
      CTG and Doppler were associated with higher rates of caesarean sections compared 
      with routine Pinard monitoring, women, health practitioners and policy makers need 
      to consider these results in the absence of evidence of short- and long-term 
      benefits for the mother or baby.Large high-quality randomised trials, particularly 
      in low-income settings, are needed. Trials should assess both short- and long-term 
      health outcomes, comparing different monitoring tools and timing for IA.

AB  - BACKGROUND: As a result of innovations in the digitalization of healthcare new 
      technologies, such as remote sensoring are gaining in importance for the collection 
      of real-life data in addition to the regular medical examination. This enables 
      a closer view into the daily lives of patients with multiple sclerosis and a more 
      detailed monitoring of disease progression. OBJECTIVE: This article gives a summary 
      of sensor-based measurement technologies in the field of multiple sclerosis RESULTS: 
      A wide variety of sensor-based measurement technologies are already available, which 
      largely focus on gait analysis and mobility. Furthermore, there are many innovative 
      approaches for a sensor-based collation of the multifocal symptoms of multiple 
      sclerosis, for example technologies focus on the area of stress surveillance, the 
      autonomic nervous system, GPS tracking and sleep monitoring. DISCUSSION: Despite the 
      existence of many already available technologies, the aim is now to find a practical 
      way to integrate them into the daily routine of patient monitoring, which includes 
      standardized data collection, evaluation and interpretation. Only at this point a 
      perspective benefit for treating physicians and patients can be achieved.

TI  - Cross-sectional Comparison of the Epidemiology of DSM-5 Generalized Anxiety Disorder 
      Across the Globe.
PG  - 465-475
LID - 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2017.0056 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is poorly understood compared with 
      other anxiety disorders, and debates persist about the seriousness of this disorder. 
      Few data exist on GAD outside a small number of affluent, industrialized nations. No 
      population-based data exist on GAD as it is currently defined in DSM-5. OBJECTIVE: 
      To provide the first epidemiologic data on DSM-5 GAD and explore cross-national 
      differences in its prevalence, course, correlates, and impact. DESIGN, SETTING, AND 
      PARTICIPANTS: Data come from the World Health Organization World Mental Health 
      Survey Initiative. Cross-sectional general population surveys were carried out in 26 
      countries using a consistent research protocol and assessment instrument. A total of 
      147 261 adults from representative household samples were interviewed face-to-face 
      in the community. The surveys were conducted between 2001 and 2012. Data analysis 
      was performed from July 22, 2015, to December 12, 2016. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: 
      The Composite International Diagnostic Interview was used to assess GAD along with 
      comorbid disorders, role impairment, and help seeking. RESULTS: Respondents were 
      147 261 adults aged 18 to 99 years. The surveys had a weighted mean response rate of 
      69.5%. Across surveys, DSM-5 GAD had a combined lifetime prevalence (SE) of 3.7% 
      (0.1%), 12-month prevalence of 1.8% (0.1%), and 30-day prevalence of 0.8% (0). 
      Prevalence estimates varied widely across countries, with lifetime prevalence 
      highest in high-income countries (5.0% [0.1%]), lower in middle-income countries 
      (2.8% [0.1%]), and lowest in low-income countries (1.6% [0.1%]). Generalized anxiety 
      disorder typically begins in adulthood and persists over time, although onset is 
      later and clinical course is more persistent in lower-income countries. Lifetime 
      comorbidity is high (81.9% [0.7%]), particularly with mood (63.0% [0.9%]) and other 
      anxiety (51.7% [0.9%]) disorders. Severe role impairment is common across life 
      domains (50.6% [1.2%]), particularly in high-income countries. Treatment is sought 
      by approximately half of affected individuals (49.2% [1.2%]), especially those with 
      severe role impairment (59.4% [1.8%]) or comorbid disorders (55.8% [1.4%]) and those 
      living in high-income countries (59.0% [1.3%]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The 
      findings of this study show that DSM-5 GAD is more prevalent than DSM-IV GAD and is 
      associated with substantial role impairment. The disorder is especially common and 
      impairing in high-income countries despite a negative association between GAD and 
      socioeconomic status within countries. These results underscore the public health 
      significance of GAD across the globe while uncovering cross-national differences in 
      prevalence, course, and impairment that require further investigation.

TI  - Wearable-Based Affect Recognition-A Review.
LID - 10.3390/s19194079 [doi]
LID - 4079
AB  - Affect recognition is an interdisciplinary research field bringing together 
      researchers from natural and social sciences. Affect recognition research aims to 
      detect the affective state of a person based on observables, with the goal to, for 
      example, provide reasoning for the person's decision making or to support mental 
      wellbeing (e.g., stress monitoring). Recently, beside of approaches based on audio, 
      visual or text information, solutions relying on wearable sensors as observables, 
      recording mainly physiological and inertial parameters, have received increasing 
      attention. Wearable systems enable an ideal platform for long-term affect 
      recognition applications due to their rich functionality and form factor, while 
      providing valuable insights during everyday life through integrated sensors. 
      However, existing literature surveys lack a comprehensive overview of 
      state-of-the-art research in wearable-based affect recognition. Therefore, the aim 
      of this paper is to provide a broad overview and in-depth understanding of the 
      theoretical background, methods and best practices of wearable affect and stress 
      recognition. Following a summary of different psychological models, we detail the 
      influence of affective states on the human physiology and the sensors commonly 
      employed to measure physiological changes. Then, we outline lab protocols eliciting 
      affective states and provide guidelines for ground truth generation in field 
      studies. We also describe the standard data processing chain and review common 
      approaches related to the preprocessing, feature extraction and classification 
      steps. By providing a comprehensive summary of the state-of-the-art and guidelines 
      to various aspects, we would like to enable other researchers in the field to 
      conduct and evaluate user studies and develop wearable systems.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Psychotherapy is one of the most common pathways to help 
      individuals address any mental disorders. However, the traditional method of 
      assessing mental health has a margin for improvement. The recent advances in digital 
      technology (e.g., smartphones and wearables) and machine learning techniques can 
      support psychotherapy through the addition of psychophysiology. This paper presents 
      RevitalMe, a context-aware model for assisting a psychotherapeutic understanding of 
      human behavior, providing psychophysiological insights from real-life. METHODS: Five 
      volunteers used RevitalMe's prototype in natural environments for eight days each. 
      Ecological Momentary Assessment was used to collect individuals' stressful states, 
      and to label real-life data. The Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test was performed to verify a 
      significant difference between the labeled states. Then, RevitalMe classified 
      psychological states based on physiological measurements through machine learning, 
      associating them with the behavior of the individual. After that, visual insights 
      were generated through contexts processing and presented to psychotherapists as 
      evidence of an individual's daily behavior and psychological state. Twelve 
      psychotherapists evaluated the clinical acceptability of RevitalMe, answering six 
      quantitative statements and two qualitative questions. Furthermore, a t-Test was 
      performed to investigate clinical acceptability given therapy field and clinical 
      years. RESULTS: The Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test succeeds in proving that labeled 
      states were statistically significant, and RevitalMe achieved an F1-Score of 75% in 
      the binary classification of stressed states in natural environments. The evaluation 
      showed clinical acceptability of 90%, composed by partial agreement of 62% and a 
      total agreement of 28%. In this regard, the t-Test provided that the level of 
      interest from cognitive-behavior therapists in psychophysiological insight was 
      higher than that from psychodynamic therapists. CONCLUSIONS: The psychophysiological 
      insights approximate cognitive-behavior psychotherapy to individual's behavior and 
      daily events, focusing on assistance in mental healthcare.

TI  - Women's Perceptions of Living a Traumatic Childbirth Experience and Factors Related 
      to a Birth Experience.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph16091654 [doi]
LID - 1654
AB  - Although identified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a global health 
      priority, maternal mental health does not receive much attention even in the health 
      systems of developed countries. With pregnancy monitoring protocols placing priority 
      on the physical health of the mother, there is a paucity of literature documenting 
      the traumatising effects of the birth process. To address this knowledge gap, this 
      qualitative descriptive study aimed to investigate women perceptions of living a 
      traumatic childbirth experience and the factors related to it. Qualitative data, 
      collected via semi-structured interviews with 32 participants recruited from parent 
      support groups and social media in Spain, were analyzed through a six-phase 
      inductive thematic analysis. Data analysis revealed five major themes-"Birth Plan 
      Compliance", "Obstetric Problems", "Mother-Infant Bond", "Emotional Wounds" and 
      "Perinatal Experiences"-and 13 subthemes. The majority of responses mentioned 
      feelings of being un/misinformed by healthcare personnel, being disrespected and 
      objectified, lack of support, and various problems during childbirth and postpartum. 
      Fear, loneliness, traumatic stress, and depression were recurrent themes in 
      participants' responses. As the actions of healthcare personnel can substantially 
      impact a birth experience, the study findings strongly suggest the need for proper 
      policies, procedures, training, and support to minimise negative consequences of 
      childbirth.

TI  - Efficacy of Prednisolone in bronchiolitis with and without family history of atopy.
PG  - 1448-1452
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine decrease in respiratory distress and hospital stay in 
      bronchiolitis patients with and without family history of atopy when treated with 
      prednisolone. METHODS: The multi-centre quasi-experimental study was conducted in 
      three hospitals of Sialkot, Pakistan, from October 2017 to March 2018, and comprised 
      patients of bronchiolitis who were divided into 2 groups on the basis of presence or 
      absence of family history of atopy. Half of the patients in each group received oral 
      prednisolone 2mg/kg/day for three consecutive days along with supportive care, and 
      the remaining half received only supportive care. Patients were monitored at 12 and 
      24 hours for clinical response using Modified Respiratory distress Assessment 
      Instrument score. Length of hospital stay was monitored upto 72 hours. SPSS 20 was 
      used for data analysis. RESULTS: Of the 212 patients, 72(34%) were in the atopic 
      group and 140(66%) in the non-atopic group. In atopic group, there was a significant 
      respiratory distress difference observed between steroid and non-steroid subgroups 
      at 24 hours (p=0.001) and all (100%) patients in the steroid subgroup got discharged 
      at 24 hours, while only 8(22%) were discharged in the non-steroid subgroup. In 
      non-atopic group, no significant improvement in corresponding terms was observed 
      (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Oral prednisolone in bronchiolitis was found to be only 
      effective in patients with family history of atopy.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Large-scale neuroimaging studies have revealed group differences in 
      cortical thickness across many psychiatric disorders. The underlying neurobiology 
      behind these differences is not well understood. OBJECTIVE: To determine 
      neurobiologic correlates of group differences in cortical thickness between cases 
      and controls in 6 disorders: attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism 
      spectrum disorder (ASD), bipolar disorder (BD), major depressive disorder (MDD), 
      obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and schizophrenia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND 
      PARTICIPANTS: Profiles of group differences in cortical thickness between cases and 
      controls were generated using T1-weighted magnetic resonance images. Similarity 
      between interregional profiles of cell-specific gene expression and those in the 
      group differences in cortical thickness were investigated in each disorder. Next, 
      principal component analysis was used to reveal a shared profile of group difference 
      in thickness across the disorders. Analysis for gene coexpression, clustering, and 
      enrichment for genes associated with these disorders were conducted. Data analysis 
      was conducted between June and December 2019. The analysis included 145 cohorts 
      across 6 psychiatric disorders drawn from the ENIGMA consortium. The numbers of 
      cases and controls in each of the 6 disorders were as follows: ADHD: 1814 and 1602; 
      ASD: 1748 and 1770; BD: 1547 and 3405; MDD: 2658 and 3572; OCD: 2266 and 2007; and 
      schizophrenia: 2688 and 3244. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Interregional profiles of 
      group difference in cortical thickness between cases and controls. RESULTS: A total 
      of 12 721 cases and 15 600 controls, ranging from ages 2 to 89 years, were included 
      in this study. Interregional profiles of group differences in cortical thickness for 
      each of the 6 psychiatric disorders were associated with profiles of gene expression 
      specific to pyramidal (CA1) cells, astrocytes (except for BD), and microglia (except 
      for OCD); collectively, gene-expression profiles of the 3 cell types explain between 
      25% and 54% of variance in interregional profiles of group differences in cortical 
      thickness. Principal component analysis revealed a shared profile of difference in 
      cortical thickness across the 6 disorders (48% variance explained); interregional 
      profile of this principal component 1 was associated with that of the pyramidal-cell 
      gene expression (explaining 56% of interregional variation). Coexpression analyses 
      of these genes revealed 2 clusters: (1) a prenatal cluster enriched with genes 
      involved in neurodevelopmental (axon guidance) processes and (2) a postnatal cluster 
      enriched with genes involved in synaptic activity and plasticity-related processes. 
      These clusters were enriched with genes associated with all 6 psychiatric disorders. 
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, shared neurobiologic processes were 
      associated with differences in cortical thickness across multiple psychiatric 
      disorders. These processes implicate a common role of prenatal development and 
      postnatal functioning of the cerebral cortex in these disorders.

AB  - Mechanical ventilation can initiate ventilator-associated lung injury (VALI) and 
      contribute to the development of multiple organ dysfunction. Although a lung 
      protective strategy limiting both tidal volume and plateau pressure reduces VALI, 
      uneven intrapulmonary gas distribution is still capable of increasing regional 
      stress and strain, especially in non-homogeneous lungs, such as during acute 
      respiratory distress syndrome. Real-time monitoring of regional ventilation may 
      prevent inhomogeneous ventilation, leading to a reduction in VALI. Electrical 
      impedance tomography (EIT) is a technique performed at the patient's bedside. It is 
      noninvasive and radiation-free and provides dynamic tidal images of gas 
      distribution. Studies have reported that EIT provides useful information both in 
      animal and clinical studies during mechanical ventilation. EIT has been shown to be 
      useful during lung recruitment, titration of positive end-expiratory pressure, lung 
      volume estimation, and evaluation of homogeneity of gas distribution in a single EIT 
      measure or in combination with multiple EIT measures. EIT-guided mechanical 
      ventilation preserved the alveolar architecture and maintained oxygenation and lung 
      mechanics better than low-tidal volume ventilation in animal models. However, 
      careful assessment is required for data analysis owing to the limited understanding 
      of the results of EIT interpretation. Previous studies indicate monitoring regional 
      ventilation by EIT is feasible in the intensive care setting and has potential to 
      lead to lung protective ventilation. Further clinical studies are warranted to 
      evaluate whether monitoring of regional ventilation using EIT can shorten the 
      duration of ventilation or improve mortality in patients with acute respiratory 
      distress syndrome.

AB  - The appraisal of stress in plants is of great relevance in agriculture and any time 
      the transport of living plants is involved. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are an 
      optimal solution to simultaneously monitor a large number of plants in a mostly 
      automatic way. A number of sensors are readily available to monitor indicators that 
      are likely related to stress. The most common of them include the levels of total 
      volatile compounds and CO(2) together with common physical parameters such as 
      temperature, relative humidity, and illumination, which are known to affect plants' 
      behavior. Recent progress in microsensors and communication technologies, such as 
      the LoRa protocol, makes it possible to design sensor nodes of high sensitivity 
      where power consumption, transmitting distances, and costs are optimized. In this 
      paper, the design of a WSN dedicated to plant stress monitoring is described. The 
      nodes have been tested on European privet (Ligustrum Jonandrum) kept in completely 
      different conditions in order to induce opposite level of stress. The results 
      confirmed the relationship between the release of total Volatile Organic Compounds 
      (VOCs) and the environmental conditions. A machine learning model based on recursive 
      neural networks demonstrates that total VOCs can be estimated from the measure of 
      the environmental parameters.

AB  - Quantitative characterization of mouse activity, locomotion and walking patterns 
      requires the monitoring of position and activity over long periods of time. Manual 
      behavioral phenotyping, however, is time and skill-intensive, vulnerable to 
      researcher bias and often stressful for the animals. We present examples for using a 
      platform-independent open source trajectory analysis software, Traja, for 
      semi-automated analysis of high throughput mouse home-cage data for neurobehavioral 
      research. Our software quantifies numerous parameters of movement including traveled 
      distance, velocity, turnings, and laterality which are demonstrated for application 
      to neurobehavioral analysis. In this study, the open source software for trajectory 
      analysis Traja is applied to movement and walking pattern observations of transient 
      stroke induced female C57BL/6 mice (30 min middle cerebral artery occlusion) on an 
      acute multinutrient diet intervention (Fortasyn). After stroke induction mice were 
      single housed in Digital Ventilated Cages [DVC, GM500, Tecniplast S.p.A., Buguggiate 
      (VA), Italy] and activity was recorded 24/7, every 250 ms using a DVC board. 
      Significant changes in activity, velocity, and distance walked are computed with 
      Traja. Traja identified increased walked distance and velocity in Control and 
      Fortasyn animals over time. No diet effect was found in preference of turning 
      direction (laterality) and distance traveled. As open source software for trajectory 
      analysis, Traja supports independent development and validation of numerical methods 
      and provides a useful tool for computational analysis of 24/7 mouse locomotion in 
      home-cage environment for application in behavioral research or movement disorders.

TI  - Misuse of prescribed opioids in the United States.
PG  - 345-353
LID - 10.1002/pds.4743 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the prevalence and correlates of self-reported misuse of 
      prescribed-opioid medications in the US general population. METHOD: In 31 068 adult 
      participants of the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) 2015 and 2016 who 
      reported using opioids in the past year, we assessed the prevalence and correlates 
      of self-reported misuse of prescribed opioids, defined as using a larger dose, more 
      frequently, or longer than prescribed. Multivariable logistic-regression models and 
      the machine-learning method of boosted regression were used to identify the 
      correlates of misuse. RESULTS: On the basis of weighted NSDUH estimates, of more 
      than 89 million US adults who used prescription opioids every year, close to 3.9 
      million (4.4%) reported misused the prescribed medications. Prescribed-opioid misuse 
      was most strongly associated with co-occurring misuse of opioids without a 
      prescription, misuse of benzodiazepines, other drug-use disorders, history of 
      illegal activity, and psychological distress. Misuse of prescribed opioids was also 
      strongly associated with prescription opioid-use disorder, especially among those 
      who misused more potent opioids or started misusing opioids before the current year. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Misuse of prescribed opioids is associated with other high-risk 
      behaviors and adverse health outcomes. The findings call for better monitoring of 
      opioid prescription in clinical practice.

      whether we can detect and prevent stress with smartphones and wearable sensors. In 
      this survey, we will examine the recent works on stress detection in daily life 
      which are using smartphones and wearable devices. Although there are a number of 
      works related to stress detection in controlled laboratory conditions, the number of 
      studies examining stress detection in daily life is limited. We will divide and 
      investigate the works according to used physiological modality and their targeted 
      environment such as office, campus, car and unrestricted daily life conditions. We 
      will also discuss promising techniques, alleviation methods and research challenges.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The presence of noise sources could reduce the diagnostic 
      capability of the ECG signal and result in inappropriate treatment decisions. To 
      mitigate this problem, automated algorithms to detect artefacts and quantify the 
      quality of the recorded signal are needed. In this study we present an automated 
      method for the detection of artefacts and quantification of the signal quality. The 
      suggested methodology extracts descriptive features from the autocorrelation 
      function and feeds these to a RUSBoost classifier. The posterior probability of the 
      clean class is used to create a continuous signal quality assessment index. Firstly, 
      the robustness of the proposed algorithm is investigated and secondly, the novel 
      signal quality assessment index is evaluated. METHODS: Data were used from three 
      different studies: a Sleep study, the PhysioNet 2017 Challenge and a Stress study. 
      Binary labels, clean or contaminated, were available from different annotators with 
      experience in ECG analysis. Two types of realistic ECG noise from the MIT-BIH Noise 
      Stress Test Database (NSTDB) were added to the Sleep study to test the quality 
      index. Firstly, the model was trained on the Sleep dataset and subsequently tested 
      on a subset of the other two datasets. Secondly, all recording conditions were taken 
      into account by training the model on a subset derived from the three datasets. 
      Lastly, the posterior probabilities of the model for the different levels of 
      agreement between the annotators were compared. RESULTS: AUC values between 0.988 
      and 1.000 were obtained when training the model on the Sleep dataset. These results 
      were further improved when training on the three datasets and thus taking all 
      recording conditions into account. A Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.8131 was 
      observed between the score of the clean class and the level of agreement. 
      Additionally, significant quality decreases per noise level for both types of added 
      noise were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The main novelty of this study is the new approach 
      to ECG signal quality assessment based on the posterior clean class probability of 
      the classifier.

TI  - Electrodermal Activity Based Pre-surgery Stress Detection Using a Wrist Wearable.
PG  - 92-100
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2019.2893222 [doi]
AB  - Surgery is a particularly potent stressor and the detrimental effects of stress on 
      people undergoing any surgery is indisputable. When left unchecked, the pre-surgery 
      stress adversely impacts people's physical and psychological well-being, and may 
      even evolve into severe pathological states. Therefore, it is essential to identify 
      levels of preoperative stress in surgical patients. This paper focuses on developing 
      an automatic pre-surgery stress detection scheme based on electrodermal activity 
      (EDA). The measurement set up involves a wrist wearable that monitors EDA of a 
      subject continuously in the most non-invasive and unobtrusive manner. Data were 
      collected from 41 subjects [17 females and 24 males, age: 54.8 ± 16.8 years (mean ± 
      SD)], who subsequently underwent different surgical procedures at the Sri 
      Ramakrishna Hospital, Coimbatore, India. A supervised machine learning algorithm 
      that detects motion artifacts in the recorded EDA data was developed. It yielded an 
      accuracy of 97.83% on a new user dataset. The clean EDA data were further analyzed 
      to determine low, moderate, and high levels of stress. A novel localized supervised 
      learning scheme based on the adaptive partitioning of the dataset was adopted for 
      stress detection. Consequently, the interindividual variability in the EDA due to 
      person-specific factors such as the sweat gland density and skin thickness, which 
      may lead to erroneous classification, could be eliminated. The scheme yielded a 
      classification accuracy of 85.06% on a new user dataset and proved to be more 
      effective than the general supervised classification model.

LID - 16354
AB  - There is a critical need for better analytical methods to study mitochondria in 
      normal and diseased states. Mitochondrial image analysis is typically done on still 
      images using slow manual methods or automated methods of limited types of features. 
      MitoMo integrated software overcomes these bottlenecks by automating rapid unbiased 
      quantitative analysis of mitochondrial morphology, texture, motion, and 
      morphogenesis and advances machine-learning classification to predict cell health by 
      combining features. Our pixel-based approach for motion analysis evaluates the 
      magnitude and direction of motion of: (1) molecules within mitochondria, (2) 
      individual mitochondria, and (3) distinct morphological classes of mitochondria. 
      MitoMo allows analysis of mitochondrial morphogenesis in time-lapse videos to study 
      early progression of cellular stress. Biological applications are presented 
      including: (1) establishing normal phenotypes of mitochondria in different cell 
      types; (2) quantifying stress-induced mitochondrial hyperfusion in cells treated 
      with an environmental toxicant, (3) tracking morphogenesis in mitochondria 
      undergoing swelling, and (4) evaluating early changes in cell health when 
      morphological abnormalities are not apparent. MitoMo unlocks new information on 
      mitochondrial phenotypes and dynamics by enabling deep analysis of mitochondrial 
      features in any cell type and can be applied to a broad spectrum of research 
      problems in cell biology, drug testing, toxicology, and medicine.

AB  - Developing accurate models of crop stress, phenology and productivity is of 
      paramount importance, given the increasing need of food. Earth observation (EO) 
      remote sensing data provides a unique source of information to monitor crops in a 
      temporally resolved and spatially explicit way. In this study, we propose the 
      combination of multisensor (optical and microwave) remote sensing data for crop 
      yield estimation and forecasting using two novel approaches. We first propose the 
      lag between Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) derived from MODIS and Vegetation 
      Optical Depth (VOD) derived from SMAP as a new joint metric combining the 
      information from the two satellite sensors in a unique feature or descriptor. Our 
      second approach avoids summarizing statistics and uses machine learning to combine 
      full time series of EVI and VOD. This study considers two statistical methods, a 
      regularized linear regression and its nonlinear extension called kernel ridge 
      regression to directly estimate the county-level surveyed total production, as well 
      as individual yields of the major crops grown in the region: corn, soybean and 
      wheat. The study area includes the US Corn Belt, and we use agricultural survey data 
      from the National Agricultural Statistics Service (USDA-NASS) for year 2015 for 
      quantitative assessment. Results show that (1) the proposed EVI-VOD lag metric 
      correlates well with crop yield and outperforms common single-sensor metrics for 
      crop yield estimation; (2) the statistical (machine learning) models working 
      directly with the time series largely improve results compared to previously 
      reported estimations; (3) the combined exploitation of information from the optical 
      and microwave data leads to improved predictions over the use of single sensor 
      approaches with coefficient of determination R  ≥ 20.76 ; (4) when models are used 
      for within-season forecasting with limited time information, crop yield prediction 
      is feasible up to four months before harvest (models reach a plateau in accuracy); 
      and (5) the robustness of the approach is confirmed in a multi-year setting, 
      reaching similar performances than when using single-year data. In conclusion, 
      results confirm the value of using both EVI and VOD at the same time, and the 
      advantage of using automatic machine learning models for crop yield/production 
      estimation.

AB  - Epilepsy is a unique neurologic condition characterized by recurrent seizures, where 
      causes, underlying biomarkers, triggers, and patterns differ across individuals. The 
      unpredictability of seizures can heighten fear and anxiety in people with epilepsy, 
      making it difficult to take part in day-to-day activities. Epilepsy researchers have 
      prioritized developing seizure prediction algorithms to combat episodic seizures for 
      decades, but the utility and effectiveness of prediction algorithms has not been 
      investigated thoroughly in clinical settings. In contrast, seizure forecasts, which 
      theoretically provide the probability of a seizure at any time (as opposed to 
      predicting the next seizure occurrence), may be more feasible. Many advances have 
      been made over the past decade in the field of seizure forecasting, including 
      improvements in algorithms as a result of machine learning and exploration of 
      non-EEG-based measures of seizure susceptibility, such as physiological biomarkers, 
      behavioral changes, environmental drivers, and cyclic seizure patterns. For example, 
      recent work investigating periodicities in individual seizure patterns has 
      determined that more than 90% of people have circadian rhythms in their seizures, 
      and many also experience multiday, weekly, or longer cycles. Other potential 
      indicators of seizure susceptibility include stress levels, heart rate, and sleep 
      quality, all of which have the potential to be captured noninvasively over long time 
      scales. There are many possible applications of a seizure-forecasting device, 
      including improving quality of life for people with epilepsy, guiding treatment 
      plans and medication titration, optimizing presurgical monitoring, and focusing 
      scientific research. To realize this potential, it is vital to better understand the 
      user requirements of a seizure-forecasting device, continue to advance forecasting 
      algorithms, and design clear guidelines for prospective clinical trials of seizure 
      forecasting.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to explore psychological distress and examine 
      the relationship between this distress and individual, family, and school factors 
      among adolescents in four low- and middle-income countries (LAMICs) in Asia (i.e., 
      Laos, Mongolia, Nepal, and Sri Lanka). METHODS: A total of 4,098 adolescents 
      attending public schools in the four LAMICs were surveyed as part of the Healthy 
      School Development Project, which aimed to develop school capacity for improving (1) 
      health among all school members and (2) the school environment through tailored 
      school health programs. Psychological distress, family factors (i.e., parental 
      understanding and monitoring, and parental tobacco and alcohol use), and school 
      factors (i.e., having close friends, not bullied, school attendance, and health 
      education) were assessed using self-report questionnaires. Data were collected from 
      September to November in 2012 and 2013. Data analysis comprised descriptive 
      statistics, Chi-squared testing, and logistic regression. RESULTS: Over half of the 
      participants were women (53.2%-64.1%), and 33.7% (in Sri Lanka) to 53.8% (in Laos) 
      were aged older than 15 years. Approximately 32.9% reported the presence of 
      psychological distress; moreover, 7.9%-13.2% reported suicidal ideation. Parental 
      monitoring and being bullied were associated with psychological distress in all four 
      countries. CONCLUSION: One-third of adolescents experience psychological distress 
      across these four LAMICs, which poses a substantial public health issue. Adolescents 
      can benefit from family and school-based approaches for screening, ameliorating, and 
      preventing psychological distress.

TI  - Neonatal CPAP for Respiratory Distress Across Malawi and Mortality.
LID - e20190668 [pii]
LID - 10.1542/peds.2019-0668 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Our aim in this observational study was to monitor continuous positive 
      airway pressure (CPAP) usage and outcomes in newborn wards at 26 government 
      hospitals in Malawi after the introduction of CPAP as part of a quality-improvement 
      initiative. CPAP was implemented in 3 phases from 2013 through 2015. METHODS: 
      Survival to discharge was analyzed for neonates treated with nasal oxygen and/or 
      CPAP with admission weights of 1 to 2.49 kg at 24 government hospitals with transfer 
      rates <15%. This analysis includes neonates admitted with respiratory illness for 
      5.5 months before (621 neonates) and 15 months immediately after CPAP implementation 
      (1836 neonates). A follow-up data analysis was completed for neonates treated with 
      CPAP at all hospitals during an additional 11 months (194 neonates). RESULTS: On 
      implementation of CPAP, survival to discharge improved for all neonates admitted 
      with respiratory distress (48.6% vs 54.5%; P = .012) and for those diagnosed with 
      respiratory distress syndrome (39.8% vs 48.3%; P = .042). There were no significant 
      differences in outcomes for neonates treated with CPAP during the implementation and 
      follow-up periods. Hypothermia on admission was pervasive and associated with poor 
      outcomes. Neonates with normal mean temperatures during CPAP treatment experienced 
      the highest survival rates (65.7% for all neonates treated with CPAP and 60.0% for 
      those diagnosed with respiratory distress syndrome). CONCLUSIONS: A nurse-led CPAP 
      service can improve outcomes for neonates in respiratory distress in low-resource 
      settings. However, the results show that real-world improvements in survival may be 
      limited without access to comprehensive newborn care, especially for small and sick 
      infants.

AB  - The growth in information technology and computer capacity has opened up 
      opportunities to deal with much and much larger data sets than even a decade ago. 
      There has been a technological revolution of big data and Artificial Intelligence 
      (AI). Perhaps many readers would immediately think about robotic surgery or 
      self-driving cars, but there is much more to AI. This Short Communication starts 
      with an overview of the key terms, including AI, machine learning, deep learning and 
      Big Data. This Short Communication highlights so developments of AI in health that 
      could benefit a low-income country like Nepal and stresses the need for Nepal's 
      health and education systems to track such developments and apply them locally. 
      Moreover, Nepal needs to start growing its own AI expertise to help develop national 
      or South Asian solutions. This would require investing in local resources such as 
      access to computer power/capacity as well as training young Nepali to work in AI.

      decision-making.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.51260 [doi]
LID - e51260
AB  - Involvement of dopamine in regulating exploration during decision-making has long 
      been hypothesized, but direct causal evidence in humans is still lacking. Here, we 
      use a combination of computational modeling, pharmacological intervention and 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging to address this issue. Thirty-one healthy male 
      participants performed a restless four-armed bandit task in a within-subjects design 
      under three drug conditions: 150 mg of the dopamine precursor L-dopa, 2 mg of the D2 
      receptor antagonist haloperidol, and placebo. Choices were best explained by an 
      extension of an established Bayesian learning model accounting for perseveration, 
      directed exploration and random exploration. Modeling revealed attenuated directed 
      exploration under L-dopa, while neural signatures of exploration, exploitation and 
      prediction error were unaffected. Instead, L-dopa attenuated neural representations 
      of overall uncertainty in insula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. Our results 
      highlight the computational role of these regions in exploration and suggest that 
      dopamine modulates how this circuit tracks accumulating uncertainty during 
      decision-making.

TI  - Application of data mining algorithms for improving stress prediction of automobile 
      drivers: A case study in Jordan.

AB  - Driving daily through traffic congestion has been recognised as a major cause of 
      stress. High levels of stress while driving negatively impact the driver's decisions 
      which could potentially lead to accidents and other long-term health hazards. 
      Accordingly, there is a great need to determine stress levels for drivers based on 
      measuring and predicting the major causes (features or classes) that increase stress 
      levels. In this paper, the problem of predicting automobile drivers' stress levels, 
      as experienced during actual driving, is investigated through the application of 
      five different data mining algorithms, namely K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Decision 
      Tree (J48), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Artificial Neural 
      Networks (ANN). An experiment was conducted on 14 drivers taking various routes in 
      Amman - Jordan, with a wearable biomedical device attached to the driver to 
      instantly collect physiological data. The collected data (dataset) is grouped into 
      two different categories, namely 'Yes' to signify the presence of stress and 'No' to 
      signify the absence of stress. In order to efficiently apply data mining algorithms 
      to the data set, oversampling was used to avoid the negative effect of driver 
      samples with a lesser class on the prediction of stress. The findings are evaluated 
      in relation to stress prediction and accordingly contrasted alongside standard 
      reference approaches that do not consider oversampling and/or feature selection 
      using the Friedman rank test. The proposed approach, in combination with RF, was 
      seen to surpass any others in terms of accuracy, AUC, specificity, and sensitivity. 
      The accuracy, AUC, specificity, and sensitivity rates produced by RF utilising our 
      proposed approach were 98.92%, 99.91%, 98.46%, and 99.36%, respectively.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In this work, we address the problem of detecting and 
      discriminating acute psychological stress (APS) in the presence of concurrent 
      physical activity (PA) using wristband biosignals. We focused on signals available 
      from wearable devices that can be worn in daily life because the ultimate objective 
      of this work is to provide APS and PA information in real-time management of chronic 
      conditions such as diabetes by automated personalized insulin delivery. Monitoring 
      APS noninvasively throughout free-living conditions remains challenging because the 
      responses to APS and PA of many physiological variables measured by wearable devices 
      are similar. METHODS: Various classification algorithms are compared to 
      simultaneously detect and discriminate the PA (sedentary state, treadmill running, 
      and stationary bike) and the type of APS (non-stress state, mental stress, and 
      emotional anxiety). The impact of APS inducements is verified with commonly used 
      self-reported questionnaires (The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)). To aid the 
      classification algorithms, novel features are generated from the physiological 
      variables reported by a wristband device during 117 hours of experiments involving 
      simultaneous APS inducement and PA. We also translate the APS assessment into a 
      quantitative metric for use in predicting the adverse outcomes. RESULTS: An accurate 
      classification of the concurrent PA and APS states is achieved with an overall 
      classification accuracy of 99% for PA and 92% for APS. The average accuracy of APS 
      detection during sedentary state, treadmill running, and stationary bike is 97.3, 
      94.1, and 84.5%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The simultaneous assessment of APS and 
      PA throughout free-living conditions from a convenient wristband device is useful 
      for monitoring the factors contributing to an elevated risk of acute events in 
      people with chronic diseases like cardiovascular complications and diabetes.

TI  - Identifying epilepsy psychiatric comorbidities with machine learning.
PG  - 388-396
LID - 10.1111/ane.13216 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: People with epilepsy are at increased risk for mental health 
      comorbidities. Machine-learning methods based on spoken language can detect 
      suicidality in adults. This study's purpose was to use spoken words to create 
      machine-learning classifiers that identify current or lifetime history of comorbid 
      psychiatric conditions in teenagers and young adults with epilepsy. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: Eligible participants were >12 years old with epilepsy. All participants 
      were interviewed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) or 
      the MINI Kid Tracking and asked five open-ended conversational questions. N-grams 
      and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) word categories were used to construct 
      machine learning classification models from language harvested from interviews. Data 
      were analyzed for four individual MINI identified disorders and for three mutually 
      exclusive groups: participants with no psychiatric disorders, participants with 
      non-suicidal psychiatric disorders, and participants with any degree of suicidality. 
      Performance was measured using areas under the receiver operating characteristic 
      curve (AROCs). RESULTS: Classifiers were constructed from 227 interviews with 122 
      participants (7.5 ± 3.1 minutes and 454 ± 299 words). AROCs for models 
      differentiating the non-overlapping groups and individual disorders ranged 57%-78% 
      (many with P < .02). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Machine-learning classifiers of 
      spoken language can reliably identify current or lifetime history of suicidality and 
      depression in people with epilepsy. Data suggest identification of anxiety and 
      bipolar disorders may be achieved with larger data sets. Machine-learning analysis 
      of spoken language can be promising as a useful screening alternative when 
      traditional approaches are unwieldy (eg, telephone calls, primary care offices, 
      school health clinics).

LID - 94
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coral reefs are facing unprecedented pressure on local and global 
      scales. Sensitive and rapid markers for ecosystem stress are urgently needed to 
      underpin effective management and restoration strategies. Although the fundamental 
      contribution of microbes to the stability and functioning of coral reefs is widely 
      recognised, it remains unclear how different reef microbiomes respond to 
      environmental perturbations and whether microbiomes are sensitive enough to predict 
      environmental anomalies that can lead to ecosystem stress. However, the lack of 
      coral reef microbial baselines hinders our ability to study the link between shifts 
      in microbiomes and ecosystem stress. In this study, we established a comprehensive 
      microbial reference database for selected Great Barrier Reef sites to assess the 
      diagnostic value of multiple free-living and host-associated reef microbiomes to 
      infer the environmental state of coral reef ecosystems. RESULTS: A comprehensive 
      microbial reference database, originating from multiple coral reef microbiomes (i.e. 
      seawater, sediment, corals, sponges and macroalgae), was generated by 16S rRNA gene 
      sequencing for 381 samples collected over the course of 16 months. By coupling this 
      database to environmental parameters, we showed that the seawater microbiome has the 
      greatest diagnostic value to infer shifts in the surrounding reef environment. In 
      fact, 56% of the observed compositional variation in the microbiome was explained by 
      environmental parameters, and temporal successions in the seawater microbiome were 
      characterised by uniform community assembly patterns. Host-associated microbiomes, 
      in contrast, were five-times less responsive to the environment and their community 
      assembly patterns were generally less uniform. By applying a suite of indicator 
      value and machine learning approaches, we further showed that seawater microbial 
      community data provide an accurate prediction of temperature and eutrophication 
      state (i.e. chlorophyll concentration and turbidity). CONCLUSION: Our results reveal 
      that free-living microbial communities have a high potential to infer environmental 
      parameters due to their environmental sensitivity and predictability. This 
      highlights the diagnostic value of microorganisms and illustrates how long-term 
      coral reef monitoring initiatives could be enhanced by incorporating assessments of 
      microbial communities in seawater. We therefore recommend timely integration of 
      microbial sampling into current coral reef monitoring initiatives.

TI  - Image-Based Phenotyping of Flowering Intensity in Cool-Season Crops.
LID - 10.3390/s20051450 [doi]
LID - 1450
AB  - The timing and duration of flowering are key agronomic traits that are often 
      associated with the ability of a variety to escape abiotic stress such as heat and 
      drought. Flowering information is valuable in both plant breeding and agricultural 
      production management. Visual assessment, the standard protocol used for phenotyping 
      flowering, is a low-throughput and subjective method. In this study, we evaluated 
      multiple imaging sensors (RGB and multiple multispectral cameras), image resolution 
      (proximal/remote sensing at 1.6 to 30 m above ground level/AGL), and image 
      processing (standard and unsupervised learning) techniques in monitoring flowering 
      intensity of four cool-season crops (canola, camelina, chickpea, and pea) to enhance 
      the accuracy and efficiency in quantifying flowering traits. The features (flower 
      area, percentage of flower area with respect to canopy area) extracted from proximal 
      (1.6-2.2 m AGL) RGB and multispectral (with near infrared, green and blue band) 
      image data were strongly correlated (r up to 0.89) with visual rating scores, 
      especially in pea and canola. The features extracted from unmanned aerial vehicle 
      integrated RGB image data (15-30 m AGL) could also accurately detect and quantify 
      large flowers of winter canola (r up to 0.84), spring canola (r up to 0.72), and pea 
      (r up to 0.72), but not camelina or chickpea flowers. When standard image processing 
      using thresholds and unsupervised machine learning such as k-means clustering were 
      utilized for flower detection and feature extraction, the results were comparable. 
      In general, for applicability of imaging for flower detection, it is recommended 
      that the image data resolution (i.e., ground sampling distance) is at least 2-3 
      times smaller than that of the flower size. Overall, this study demonstrates the 
      feasibility of utilizing imaging for monitoring flowering intensity in multiple 
      varieties of evaluated crops.

AB  - We report follow-up data evaluating the long-term outcomes for the first completed 
      trial of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy for 
      chronic, treatment-resistant post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (Mithoefer et 
      al., 2011). All of the 19 subjects who received MDMA-assisted treatment in the 
      original trial participated in the long-term follow-up (LTFU), with 16 out of 19 
      completing all of the long-term outcome measures, which were administered from 17 to 
      74 months after the original study's final MDMA session (mean = 45.4; SD = 17.3). 
      Our primary outcome measure used was the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS). 
      Secondary outcome measures were the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the 
      Neuroticism Extroversion Oppenness Personality Inventory-Revised (NEO PI-R) 
      Personality Inventory. We also collected a long-term follow-up questionnaire. 
      Results for the 16 CAPS completers showed there were no statistical differences 
      between mean CAPS score at LTFU (mean = 23.7; SD = 22.8) (t (matched) = 0.1; df = 
      15, p = 0.91) and the mean CAPS score previously obtained at Study Exit (mean = 
      24.6, SD = 18.6). On average, subjects maintained statistically and 
      clinically-significant gains in symptom relief, although two of these subjects did 
      relapse. It was promising that we found the majority of these subjects with 
      previously severe PTSD who were unresponsive to existing treatments had symptomatic 
      relief provided by MDMA-assisted psychotherapy that persisted over time, with no 
      subjects reporting harm from participation in the study.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) became established during the last decade as an 
      emerging technology with considerable potentialities and applicability. Its paradigm 
      of everything connected together penetrated the real world, with smart devices 
      located in several daily appliances. Such intelligent objects are able to 
      communicate autonomously through already existing network infrastructures, thus 
      generating a more concrete integration between real world and computer-based 
      systems. On the downside, the great benefit carried by the IoT paradigm in our life 
      brings simultaneously severe security issues, since the information exchanged among 
      the objects frequently remains unprotected from malicious attackers. The paper at 
      hand proposes COSMOS (Collaborative, Seamless and Adaptive Sentinel for the Internet 
      of Things), a novel sentinel to protect smart environments from cyber threats. Our 
      sentinel shields the IoT devices using multiple defensive rings, resulting in a more 
      accurate and robust protection. Additionally, we discuss the current deployment of 
      the sentinel on a commodity device (i.e., Raspberry Pi). Exhaustive experiments are 
      conducted on the sentinel, demonstrating that it performs meticulously even in 
      heavily stressing conditions. Each defensive layer is tested, reaching a remarkable 
      performance, thus proving the applicability of COSMOS in a distributed and dynamic 
      scenario such as IoT. With the aim of easing the enjoyment of the proposed sentinel, 
      we further developed a friendly and ease-to-use COSMOS App, so that end-users can 
      manage sentinel(s) directly using their own devices (e.g., smartphone).

AB  - In agriculture, early detection of plant stresses is advantageous in preventing crop 
      yield losses. Remote sensors are increasingly being utilized for crop health 
      monitoring, offering non-destructive, spatialized detection and the quantification 
      of plant diseases at various levels of measurement. Advances in sensor technologies 
      have promoted the development of novel techniques for precision agriculture. As in 
      situ techniques are surpassed by multispectral imaging, refinement of hyperspectral 
      imaging and the promising emergence of light detection and ranging (LIDAR), remote 
      sensing will define the future of biotic and abiotic plant stress detection, crop 
      yield estimation and product quality. The added value of LIDAR-based systems stems 
      from their greater flexibility in capturing data, high rate of data delivery and 
      suitability for a high level of automation while overcoming the shortcomings of 
      passive systems limited by atmospheric conditions, changes in light, viewing angle 
      and canopy structure. In particular, a multi-sensor systems approach and associated 
      data fusion techniques (i.e., blending LIDAR with existing electro-optical sensors) 
      offer increased accuracy in plant disease detection by focusing on traditional 
      optimal estimation and the adoption of artificial intelligence techniques for 
      spatially and temporally distributed big data. When applied across different 
      platforms (handheld, ground-based, airborne, ground/aerial robotic vehicles or 
      satellites), these electro-optical sensors offer new avenues to predict and react to 
      plant stress and disease. This review examines the key sensor characteristics, 
      platform integration options and data analysis techniques recently proposed in the 
      field of precision agriculture and highlights the key challenges and benefits of 
      each concept towards informing future research in this very important and rapidly 
      growing field.

AB  - Heat stress is one of the most important environmental stressors facing poultry 
      production and welfare worldwide. The detrimental effects of heat stress on poultry 
      range from reduced growth and egg production to impaired health. Animal 
      vocalisations are associated with different animal responses and can be used as 
      useful indicators of the state of animal welfare. It is already known that specific 
      chicken vocalisations such as alarm, squawk, and gakel calls are correlated with 
      stressful events, and therefore, could be used as stress indicators in poultry 
      monitoring systems. In this study, we focused on developing a hen vocalisation 
      detection method based on machine learning to assess their thermal comfort 
      condition. For extraction of the vocalisations, nine source-filter theory related 
      temporal and spectral features were chosen, and a support vector machine (SVM) based 
      classifier was developed. As a result, the classification performance of the optimal 
      SVM model was 95.1 ± 4.3% (the sensitivity parameter) and 97.6 ± 1.9% (the precision 
      parameter). Based on the developed algorithm, the study illustrated that a 
      significant correlation existed between specific vocalisations (alarm and squawk 
      call) and thermal comfort indices (temperature-humidity index, THI) (alarm-THI, R = 
      -0.414, P = 0.01; squawk-THI, R = 0.594, P = 0.01). This work represents the first 
      step towards the further development of technology to monitor flock vocalisations 
      with the intent of providing producers an additional tool to help them actively 
      manage the welfare of their flock.

PG  - 1001-1007
LID - 10.1177/1932296819872225 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We tested the safety and performance of the "insulin-only" configuration 
      of the bionic pancreas (BP) closed-loop blood-glucose control system in a home-use 
      setting to assess glycemic outcomes using different static and dynamic glucose 
      set-points. METHOD: This is an open-label non-randomized study with three 
      consecutive intervention periods. Participants had consecutive weeks of usual care 
      followed by the insulin-only BP with (1) an individualized static set-point of 115 
      or 130 mg/dL and (2) a dynamic set-point that automatically varied within 110 to 130 
      mg/dL, depending on hypoglycemic risk. Human factors (HF) testing was conducted 
      using validated surveys. The last five days of each study arm were used for data 
      analysis. RESULTS: Thirteen participants were enrolled with a mean age of 28 years, 
      mean A1c of 7.2%, and mean daily insulin dose of 0.6 U/kg (0.4-1.0 U/kg). The usual 
      care arm had an average glucose of 145 ± 20 mg/dL, which increased in the static 
      set-point arm (159 ± 8 mg/dL, P = .004) but not in the dynamic set-point arm (154 ± 
      10 mg/dL, P = ns). There was no significant difference in time spent in range 
      (70-180 mg/dL) among the three study arms. There was less time <70 mg/dL with both 
      the static (1.8% ± 1.4%, P = .009) and dynamic set-point (2.7±1.5, P = .051) arms 
      compared to the usual-care arm (5.5% ± 4.2%). HF testing demonstrated preliminary 
      user satisfaction and no increased risk of diabetes burden or distress. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The insulin-only configuration of the BP using either static or dynamic set-points 
      and initialized only with body weight performed similarly to other published 
      insulin-only systems.

      pandemic.

AB  - COVID-19 is caused by a novel virus with an unknown aetiology. People across the 
      globe are dealing with not only a health crisis but also an 'infodemic', a term 
      coined by the World Health Organization to refer to the avalanche of contradictory 
      information that is arousing widespread confusion and anxiety. This study aimed to 
      examine the prevalence of anxiety and sleep disturbance at the early stage of the 
      pandemic, and unveil the information coping process underlying differential 
      susceptibility to COVID-19 infection anxiety and sleep disturbance. The participants 
      were 1,270 adults (47% men, M(age)  = 42.82) from the UK and US who completed 
      initial (Time 1) and follow-up (Time 2) surveys from 16 to 22 March and 18 to 24 May 
      2020, respectively. The prevalence of probable clinically relevant anxiety was 61% 
      and 45% at the first and second time points, and more than half of the participants 
      in this anxiety group also reported mild to severe sleep disturbance. Moreover, 41% 
      of the participants perceived themselves as not having enough COVID-19-related 
      information and reported higher levels of COVID-19 infection anxiety and sleep 
      disturbance over time than those who perceived themselves as having enough of such 
      information. Moderated mediation analysis identified two groups who were more 
      vulnerable to both psychological problems: high blunters who sought COVID-19-related 
      information online more frequently and high monitors who sought such information 
      offline less frequently. These findings highlight the importance of a good match 
      between information coping style and strategy deployment in dealing with an 
      infodemic surrounding a novel disease.

TI  - Internet-based device-assisted remote monitoring of cardiovascular implantable 
      electronic devices: an evidence-based analysis.
PG  - 1-86
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this Medical Advisory Secretariat (MAS) report was to 
      conduct a systematic review of the available published evidence on the safety, 
      effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of Internet-based device-assisted remote 
      monitoring systems (RMSs) for therapeutic cardiac implantable electronic devices 
      (CIEDs) such as pacemakers (PMs), implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs), 
      and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) devices. The MAS evidence-based review 
      was performed to support public financing decisions. CLINICAL NEED: CONDITION AND 
      TARGET POPULATION: Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is a major cause of fatalities in 
      developed countries. In the United States almost half a million people die of SCD 
      annually, resulting in more deaths than stroke, lung cancer, breast cancer, and AIDS 
      combined. In Canada each year more than 40,000 people die from a cardiovascular 
      related cause; approximately half of these deaths are attributable to SCD. Most 
      cases of SCD occur in the general population typically in those without a known 
      history of heart disease. Most SCDs are caused by cardiac arrhythmia, an abnormal 
      heart rhythm caused by malfunctions of the heart’s electrical system. Up to half of 
      patients with significant heart failure (HF) also have advanced conduction 
      abnormalities. Cardiac arrhythmias are managed by a variety of drugs, ablative 
      procedures, and therapeutic CIEDs. The range of CIEDs includes pacemakers (PMs), 
      implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs), and cardiac resynchronization 
      therapy (CRT) devices. Bradycardia is the main indication for PMs and individuals at 
      high risk for SCD are often treated by ICDs. Heart failure (HF) is also a 
      significant health problem and is the most frequent cause of hospitalization in 
      those over 65 years of age. Patients with moderate to severe HF may also have 
      cardiac arrhythmias, although the cause may be related more to heart pump or 
      haemodynamic failure. The presence of HF, however, increases the risk of SCD 
      five-fold, regardless of aetiology. Patients with HF who remain highly symptomatic 
      despite optimal drug therapy are sometimes also treated with CRT devices. With an 
      increasing prevalence of age-related conditions such as chronic HF and the expanding 
      indications for ICD therapy, the rate of ICD placement has been dramatically 
      increasing. The appropriate indications for ICD placement, as well as the rate of 
      ICD placement, are increasingly an issue. In the United States, after the 
      introduction of expanded coverage of ICDs, a national ICD registry was created in 
      2005 to track these devices. A recent survey based on this national ICD registry 
      reported that 22.5% (25,145) of patients had received a non-evidence based ICD and 
      that these patients experienced significantly higher in-hospital mortality and 
      post-procedural complications. In addition to the increased ICD device placement and 
      the upfront device costs, there is the need for lifelong follow-up or surveillance, 
      placing a significant burden on patients and device clinics. In 2007, over 1.6 
      million CIEDs were implanted in Europe and the United States, which translates to 
      over 5.5 million patient encounters per year if the recommended follow-up practices 
      are considered. A safe and effective RMS could potentially improve the efficiency of 
      long-term follow-up of patients and their CIEDs. TECHNOLOGY: In addition to being 
      therapeutic devices, CIEDs have extensive diagnostic abilities. All CIEDs can be 
      interrogated and reprogrammed during an in-clinic visit using an inductive 
      programming wand. Remote monitoring would allow patients to transmit information 
      recorded in their devices from the comfort of their own homes. Currently most ICD 
      devices also have the potential to be remotely monitored. Remote monitoring (RM) can 
      be used to check system integrity, to alert on arrhythmic episodes, and to 
      potentially replace in-clinic follow-ups and manage disease remotely. They do not 
      currently have the capability of being reprogrammed remotely, although this feature 
      is being tested in pilot settings. Every RMS is specifically designed by a 
      manufacturer for their cardiac implant devices. For Internet-based device-assisted 
      RMSs, this customization includes details such as web application, multiplatform 
      sensors, custom algorithms, programming information, and types and methods of 
      alerting patients and/or physicians. The addition of peripherals for monitoring 
      weight and pressure or communicating with patients through the onsite communicators 
      also varies by manufacturer. Internet-based device-assisted RMSs for CIEDs are 
      intended to function as a surveillance system rather than an emergency system. 
      Health care providers therefore need to learn each application, and as more than one 
      application may be used at one site, multiple applications may need to be reviewed 
      for alarms. All RMSs deliver system integrity alerting; however, some systems seem 
      to be better geared to fast arrhythmic alerting, whereas other systems appear to be 
      more intended for remote follow-up or supplemental remote disease management. The 
      different RMSs may therefore have different impacts on workflow organization because 
      of their varying frequency of interrogation and methods of alerts. The integration 
      of these proprietary RM web-based registry systems with hospital-based electronic 
      health record systems has so far not been commonly implemented. Currently there are 
      2 general types of RMSs: those that transmit device diagnostic information 
      automatically and without patient assistance to secure Internet-based registry 
      systems, and those that require patient assistance to transmit information. Both 
      systems employ the use of preprogrammed alerts that are either transmitted 
      automatically or at regular scheduled intervals to patients and/or physicians. The 
      current web applications, programming, and registry systems differ greatly between 
      the manufacturers of transmitting cardiac devices. In Canada there are currently 4 
      manufacturers—Medtronic Inc., Biotronik, Boston Scientific Corp., and St Jude 
      Medical Inc.—which have regulatory approval for remote transmitting CIEDs. Remote 
      monitoring systems are proprietary to the manufacturer of the implant device. An RMS 
      for one device will not work with another device, and the RMS may not work with all 
      versions of the manufacturer’s devices. All Internet-based device-assisted RMSs have 
      common components. The implanted device is equipped with a micro-antenna that 
      communicates with a small external device (at bedside or wearable) commonly known as 
      the transmitter. Transmitters are able to interrogate programmed parameters and 
      diagnostic data stored in the patients’ implant device. The information transfer to 
      the communicator can occur at preset time intervals with the participation of the 
      patient (waving a wand over the device) or it can be sent automatically (wirelessly) 
      without their participation. The encrypted data are then uploaded to an 
      Internet-based database on a secure central server. The data processing facilities 
      at the central database, depending on the clinical urgency, can trigger an alert for 
      the physician(s) that can be sent via email, fax, text message, or phone. The 
      details are also posted on the secure website for viewing by the physician (or their 
      delegate) at their convenience. RESEARCH QUESTIONS: The research directions and 
      specific research questions for this evidence review were as follows: 1. To identify 
      the Internet-based device-assisted RMSs available for follow-up of patients with 
      therapeutic CIEDs such as PMs, ICDs, and CRT devices. 2. To identify the potential 
      risks, operational issues, or organizational issues related to Internet-based 
      device-assisted RM for CIEDs. 3. To evaluate the safety, acceptability, and 
      effectiveness of Internet-based device-assisted RMSs for CIEDs such as PMs, ICDs, 
      and CRT devices. 4. To evaluate the safety, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of 
      Internet-based device-assisted RMSs for CIEDs compared to usual outpatient in-office 
      monitoring strategies. 5. To evaluate the resource implications or budget impact of 
      RMSs for CIEDs in Ontario, Canada. RESEARCH METHODS: LITERATURE SEARCH: The review 
      included a systematic review of published scientific literature and consultations 
      with experts and manufacturers of all 4 approved RMSs for CIEDs in Canada. 
      Information on CIED cardiac implant clinics was also obtained from Provincial 
      Programs, a division within the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care with a mandate 
      for cardiac implant specialty care. Various administrative databases and registries 
      were used to outline the current clinical follow-up burden of CIEDs in Ontario. The 
      provincial population-based ICD database developed and maintained by the Institute 
      for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES) was used to review the current follow-up 
      practices with Ontario patients implanted with ICD devices. SEARCH STRATEGY: A 
      literature search was performed on September 21, 2010 using OVID MEDLINE, MEDLINE 
      In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing 
      & Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Cochrane Library, and the International 
      Agency for Health Technology Assessment (INAHTA) for studies published from 1950 to 
      September 2010. Search alerts were generated and reviewed for additional relevant 
      literature until December 31, 2010. Abstracts were reviewed by a single reviewer 
      and, for those studies meeting the eligibility criteria full-text articles were 
      obtained. Reference lists were also examined for any additional relevant studies not 
      identified through the search. INCLUSION CRITERIA: published between 1950 and 
      September 2010; English language full-reports and human studies; original reports 
      including clinical evaluations of Internet-based device-assisted RMSs for CIEDs in 
      clinical settings; reports including standardized measurements on outcome events 
      such as technical success, safety, effectiveness, cost, measures of health care 
      utilization, morbidity, mortality, quality of life or patient satisfaction; 
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs), systematic reviews and meta-analyses, cohort 
      and controlled clinical studies. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: non-systematic reviews, 
      letters, comments and editorials; reports not involving standardized outcome events; 
      clinical reports not involving Internet-based device assisted RM systems for CIEDs 
      in clinical settings; reports involving studies testing or validating algorithms 
      without RM; studies with small samples (<10 subjects). OUTCOMES OF INTEREST: The 
      outcomes of interest included: technical outcomes, emergency department visits, 
      complications, major adverse events, symptoms, hospital admissions, clinic visits 
      (scheduled and/or unscheduled), survival, morbidity (disease progression, stroke, 
      etc.), patient satisfaction, and quality of life. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: The MAS 
      evidence review was performed to review available evidence on Internet-based 
      device-assisted RMSs for CIEDs published until September 2010. The search identified 
      6 systematic reviews, 7 randomized controlled trials, and 19 reports for 16 cohort 
      studies—3 of these being registry-based and 4 being multi-centered. The evidence is 
      summarized in the 3 sections that follow. 1. Effectiveness of Remote Monitoring 
      Systems of CIEDs for Cardiac Arrhythmia and Device Functioning. In total, 15 reports 
      on 13 cohort studies involving investigations with 4 different RMSs for CIEDs in 
      cardiology implant clinic groups were identified in the review. The 4 RMSs were: 
      Care Link Network® (Medtronic Inc,, Minneapolis, MN, USA); Home Monitoring® 
      (Biotronic, Berlin, Germany); House Call 11® (St Jude Medical Inc., St Pauls, MN, 
      USA); and a manufacturer-independent RMS. Eight of these reports were with the Home 
      Monitoring® RMS (12,949 patients), 3 were with the Care Link® RMS (167 patients), 1 
      was with the House Call 11® RMS (124 patients), and 1 was with a 
      manufacturer-independent RMS (44 patients). All of the studies, except for 2 in the 
      United States, (1 with Home Monitoring® and 1 with House Call 11®), were performed 
      in European countries. The RMSs in the studies were evaluated with different cardiac 
      implant device populations: ICDs only (6 studies), ICD and CRT devices (3 studies), 
      PM and ICD and CRT devices (4 studies), and PMs only (2 studies). The patient 
      populations were predominately male (range, 52%–87%) in all studies, with mean ages 
      ranging from 58 to 76 years. One study population was unique in that RMSs were 
      evaluated for ICDs implanted solely for primary prevention in young patients (mean 
      age, 44 years) with Brugada syndrome, which carries an inherited increased genetic 
      risk for sudden heart attack in young adults. Most of the cohort studies reported on 
      the feasibility of RMSs in clinical settings with limited follow-up. In the short 
      follow-up periods of the studies, the majority of the events were related to 
      detection of medical events rather than system configuration or device 
      abnormalities. The results of the studies are summarized below: The interrogation of 
      devices on the web platform, both for continuous and scheduled transmissions, was 
      significantly quicker with remote follow-up, both for nurses and physicians. In a 
      case-control study focusing on a Brugada population–based registry with patients 
      followed-up remotely, there were significantly fewer outpatient visits and greater 
      detection of inappropriate shocks. One death occurred in the control group not 
      followed remotely and post-mortem analysis indicated early signs of lead failure 
      prior to the event. Two studies examined the role of RMSs in following ICD leads 
      under regulatory advisory in a European clinical setting and noted: – Fewer 
      inappropriate shocks were administered in the RM group. – Urgent in-office 
      interrogations and surgical revisions were performed within 12 days of remote 
      alerts. – No signs of lead fracture were detected at in-office follow-up; all were 
      detected at remote follow-up. Only 1 study reported evaluating quality of life in 
      patients followed up remotely at 3 and 6 months; no values were reported. Patient 
      satisfaction was evaluated in 5 cohort studies, all in short term follow-up: 1 for 
      the Home Monitoring® RMS, 3 for the Care Link® RMS, and 1 for the House Call 11® 
      RMS. – Patients reported receiving a sense of security from the transmitter, a good 
      relationship with nurses and physicians, positive implications for their health, and 
      satisfaction with RM and organization of services. – Although patients reported that 
      the system was easy to implement and required less than 10 minutes to transmit 
      information, a variable proportion of patients (range, 9% 39%) reported that they 
      needed the assistance of a caregiver for their transmission. – The majority of 
      patients would recommend RM to other ICD patients. – Patients with hearing or other 
      physical or mental conditions hindering the use of the system were excluded from 
      studies, but the frequency of this was not reported. Physician satisfaction was 
      evaluated in 3 studies, all with the Care Link® RMS: – Physicians reported an ease 
      of use and high satisfaction with a generally short-term use of the RMS. – 
      Physicians reported being able to address the problems in unscheduled patient 
      transmissions or physician initiated transmissions remotely, and were able to handle 
      the majority of the troubleshooting calls remotely. – Both nurses and physicians 
      reported a high level of satisfaction with the web registry system. 2. Effectiveness 
      of Remote Monitoring Systems in Heart Failure Patients for Cardiac Arrhythmia and 
      Heart Failure Episodes. Remote follow-up of HF patients implanted with ICD or CRT 
      devices, generally managed in specialized HF clinics, was evaluated in 3 cohort 
      studies: 1 involved the Home Monitoring® RMS and 2 involved the Care Link® RMS. In 
      these RMSs, in addition to the standard diagnostic features, the cardiac devices 
      continuously assess other variables such as patient activity, mean heart rate, and 
      heart rate variability. Intra-thoracic impedance, a proxy measure for lung fluid 
      overload, was also measured in the Care Link® studies. The overall diagnostic 
      performance of these measures cannot be evaluated, as the information was not 
      reported for patients who did not experience intra-thoracic impedance threshold 
      crossings or did not undergo interventions. The trial results involved descriptive 
      information on transmissions and alerts in patients experiencing high morbidity and 
      hospitalization in the short study periods. 3. Comparative Effectiveness of Remote 
      Monitoring Systems for CIEDs. Seven RCTs were identified evaluating RMSs for CIEDs: 
      2 were for PMs (1276 patients) and 5 were for ICD/CRT devices (3733 patients). 
      Studies performed in the clinical setting in the United States involved both the 
      Care Link® RMS and the Home Monitoring® RMS, whereas all studies performed in 
      European countries involved only the Home Monitoring® RMS. 3A. RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED 
      TRIALS OF REMOTE MONITORING SYSTEMS FOR PACEMAKERS: Two trials, both multicenter 
      RCTs, were conducted in different countries with different RMSs and study 
      objectives. The PREFER trial was a large trial (897 patients) performed in the 
      United States examining the ability of Care Link®, an Internet-based remote PM 
      interrogation system, to detect clinically actionable events (CAEs) sooner than the 
      current in-office follow-up supplemented with transtelephonic monitoring 
      transmissions, a limited form of remote device interrogation. The trial results are 
      summarized below: In the 375-day mean follow-up, 382 patients were identified with 
      at least 1 CAE—111 patients in the control arm and 271 in the remote arm. The event 
      rate detected per patient for every type of CAE, except for loss of atrial capture, 
      was higher in the remote arm than the control arm. The median time to first 
      detection of CAEs (4.9 vs. 6.3 months) was significantly shorter in the RMS group 
      compared to the control group (P < 0.0001). Additionally, only 2% (3/190) of the 
      CAEs in the control arm were detected during a transtelephonic monitoring 
      transmission (the rest were detected at in-office follow-ups), whereas 66% (446/676) 
      of the CAEs were detected during remote interrogation. The second study, the OEDIPE 
      trial, was a smaller trial (379 patients) performed in France evaluating the ability 
      of the Home Monitoring® RMS to shorten PM post-operative hospitalization while 
      preserving the safety of conventional management of longer hospital stays. 
      Implementation and operationalization of the RMS was reported to be successful in 
      91% (346/379) of the patients and represented 8144 transmissions. In the RM group 
      6.5% of patients failed to send messages (10 due to improper use of the transmitter, 
      2 with unmanageable stress). Of the 172 patients transmitting, 108 patients sent a 
      total of 167 warnings during the trial, with a greater proportion of warnings being 
      attributed to medical rather than technical causes. Forty percent had no warning 
      message transmission and among these, 6 patients experienced a major adverse event 
      and 1 patient experienced a non-major adverse event. Of the 6 patients having a 
      major adverse event, 5 contacted their physician. The mean medical reaction time was 
      faster in the RM group (6.5 ± 7.6 days vs. 11.4 ± 11.6 days). The mean duration of 
      hospitalization was significantly shorter (P < 0.001) for the RM group than the 
      control group (3.2 ± 3.2 days vs. 4.8 ± 3.7 days). Quality of life estimates by the 
      SF-36 questionnaire were similar for the 2 groups at 1-month follow-up. 3B. 
      RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS EVALUATING REMOTE MONITORING SYSTEMS FOR ICD OR CRT 
      DEVICES: The 5 studies evaluating the impact of RMSs with ICD/CRT devices were 
      conducted in the United States and in European countries and involved 2 RMSs—Care 
      Link® and Home Monitoring ®. The objectives of the trials varied and 3 of the trials 
      were smaller pilot investigations. The first of the smaller studies (151 patients) 
      evaluated patient satisfaction, achievement of patient outcomes, and the 
      cost-effectiveness of the Care Link® RMS compared to quarterly in-office device 
      interrogations with 1-year follow-up. Individual outcomes such as hospitalizations, 
      emergency department visits, and unscheduled clinic visits were not significantly 
      different between the study groups. Except for a significantly higher detection of 
      atrial fibrillation in the RM group, data on ICD detection and therapy were similar 
      in the study groups. Health-related quality of life evaluated by the EuroQoL at 
      6-month or 12-month follow-up was not different between study groups. Patients were 
      more satisfied with their ICD care in the clinic follow-up group than in the remote 
      follow-up group at 6-month follow-up, but were equally satisfied at 12- month 
      follow-up. The second small pilot trial (20 patients) examined the impact of RM 
      follow-up with the House Call 11® system on work schedules and cost savings in 
      patients randomized to 2 study arms varying in the degree of remote follow-up. The 
      total time including device interrogation, transmission time, data analysis, and 
      physician time required was significantly shorter for the RM follow-up group. The 
      in-clinic waiting time was eliminated for patients in the RM follow-up group. The 
      physician talk time was significantly reduced in the RM follow-up group (P < 0.05). 
      The time for the actual device interrogation did not differ in the study groups. The 
      third small trial (115 patients) examined the impact of RM with the Home Monitoring® 
      system compared to scheduled trimonthly in-clinic visits on the number of unplanned 
      visits, total costs, health-related quality of life (SF-36), and overall mortality. 
      There was a 63.2% reduction in in-office visits in the RM group. Hospitalizations or 
      overall mortality (values not stated) were not significantly different between the 
      study groups. Patient-induced visits were higher in the RM group than the in-clinic 
      follow-up group. THE TRUST TRIAL: The TRUST trial was a large multicenter RCT 
      conducted at 102 centers in the United States involving the Home Monitoring® RMS for 
      ICD devices for 1450 patients. The primary objectives of the trial were to determine 
      if remote follow-up could be safely substituted for in-office clinic follow-up (3 
      in-office visits replaced) and still enable earlier physician detection of 
      clinically actionable events. Adherence to the protocol follow-up schedule was 
      significantly higher in the RM group than the in-office follow-up group (93.5% vs. 
      88.7%, P < 0.001). Actionability of trimonthly scheduled checks was low (6.6%) in 
      both study groups. Overall, actionable causes were reprogramming (76.2%), medication 
      changes (24.8%), and lead/system revisions (4%), and these were not different 
      between the 2 study groups. The overall mean number of in-clinic and hospital visits 
      was significantly lower in the RM group than the in-office follow-up group (2.1 per 
      patient-year vs. 3.8 per patient-year, P < 0.001), representing a 45% visit 
      reduction at 12 months. The median time from onset of first arrhythmia to physician 
      evaluation was significantly shorter (P < 0.001) in the RM group than in the 
      in-office follow-up group for all arrhythmias (1 day vs. 35.5 days). The median time 
      to detect clinically asymptomatic arrhythmia events—atrial fibrillation (AF), 
      ventricular fibrillation (VF), ventricular tachycardia (VT), and supra-ventricular 
      tachycardia (SVT)—was also significantly shorter (P < 0.001) in the RM group 
      compared to the in-office follow-up group (1 day vs. 41.5 days) and was 
      significantly quicker for each of the clinical arrhythmia events—AF (5.5 days vs. 40 
      days), VT (1 day vs. 28 days), VF (1 day vs. 36 days), and SVT (2 days vs. 39 days). 
      System-related problems occurred infrequently in both groups—in 1.5% of patients 
      (14/908) in the RM group and in 0.7% of patients (3/432) in the in-office follow-up 
      group. The overall adverse event rate over 12 months was not significantly different 
      between the 2 groups and individual adverse events were also not significantly 
      different between the RM group and the in-office follow-up group: death (3.4% vs. 
      4.9%), stroke (0.3% vs. 1.2%), and surgical intervention (6.6% vs. 4.9%), 
      respectively. The 12-month cumulative survival was 96.4% (95% confidence interval 
      [CI], 95.5%–97.6%) in the RM group and 94.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 
      91.8%–96.6%) in the in-office follow-up group, and was not significantly different 
      between the 2 groups (P = 0.174). THE CONNECT TRIAL: The CONNECT trial, another 
      major multicenter RCT, involved the Care Link® RMS for ICD/CRT devices in a15-month 
      follow-up study of 1,997 patients at 133 sites in the United States. The primary 
      objective of the trial was to determine whether automatically transmitted physician 
      alerts decreased the time from the occurrence of clinically relevant events to 
      medical decisions. The trial results are summarized below: Of the 575 clinical 
      alerts sent in the study, 246 did not trigger an automatic physician alert. 
      Transmission failures were related to technical issues such as the alert not being 
      programmed or not being reset, and/or a variety of patient factors such as not being 
      at home and the monitor not being plugged in or set up. The overall mean time from 
      the clinically relevant event to the clinical decision was significantly shorter (P 
      < 0.001) by 17.4 days in the remote follow-up group (4.6 days for 172 patients) than 
      the in-office follow-up group (22 days for 145 patients). – The median time to a 
      clinical decision was shorter in the remote follow-up group than in the in-office 
      follow-up group for an AT/AF burden greater than or equal to 12 hours (3 days vs. 24 
      days) and a fast VF rate greater than or equal to 120 beats per minute (4 days vs. 
      23 days). Although infrequent, similar low numbers of events involving low battery 
      and VF detection/therapy turned off were noted in both groups. More alerts, however, 
      were noted for out-of-range lead impedance in the RM group (18 vs. 6 patients), and 
      the time to detect these critical events was significantly shorter in the RM group 
      (same day vs. 17 days). Total in-office clinic visits were reduced by 38% from 6.27 
      visits per patient-year in the in-office follow-up group to 3.29 visits per 
      patient-year in the remote follow-up group. Health care utilization visits (N = 
      6,227) that included cardiovascular-related hospitalization, emergency department 
      visits, and unscheduled clinic visits were not significantly higher in the remote 
      follow-up group. The overall mean length of hospitalization was significantly 
      shorter (P = 0.002) for those in the remote follow-up group (3.3 days vs. 4.0 days) 
      and was shorter both for patients with ICD (3.0 days vs. 3.6 days) and CRT (3.8 days 
      vs. 4.7 days) implants. The mortality rate between the study arms was not 
      significantly different between the follow-up groups for the ICDs (P = 0.31) or the 
      CRT devices with defribillator (P = 0.46). CONCLUSIONS: There is limited clinical 
      trial information on the effectiveness of RMSs for PMs. However, for RMSs for ICD 
      devices, multiple cohort studies and 2 large multicenter RCTs demonstrated 
      feasibility and significant reductions in in-office clinic follow-ups with RMSs in 
      the first year post implantation. The detection rates of clinically significant 
      events (and asymptomatic events) were higher, and the time to a clinical decision 
      for these events was significantly shorter, in the remote follow-up groups than in 
      the in-office follow-up groups. The earlier detection of clinical events in the 
      remote follow-up groups, however, was not associated with lower morbidity or 
      mortality rates in the 1-year follow-up. The substitution of almost all the first 
      year in-office clinic follow-ups with RM was also not associated with an increased 
      health care utilization such as emergency department visits or hospitalizations. The 
      follow-up in the trials was generally short-term, up to 1 year, and was a more 
      limited assessment of potential longer term device/lead integrity complications or 
      issues. None of the studies compared the different RMSs, particularly the different 
      RMSs involving patient-scheduled transmissions or automatic transmissions. Patients’ 
      acceptance of and satisfaction with RM were reported to be high, but the impact of 
      RM on patients’ health-related quality of life, particularly the psychological 
      aspects, was not evaluated thoroughly. Patients who are not technologically 
      competent, having hearing or other physical/mental impairments, were identified as 
      potentially disadvantaged with remote surveillance. Cohort studies consistently 
      identified subgroups of patients who preferred in-office follow-up. The evaluation 
      of costs and workflow impact to the health care system were evaluated in European or 
      American clinical settings, and only in a limited way. Internet-based 
      device-assisted RMSs involve a new approach to monitoring patients, their disease 
      progression, and their CIEDs. Remote monitoring also has the potential to improve 
      the current postmarket surveillance systems of evolving CIEDs and their ongoing 
      hardware and software modifications. At this point, however, there is insufficient 
      information to evaluate the overall impact to the health care system, although the 
      time saving and convenience to patients and physicians associated with a 
      substitution of in-office follow-up by RM is more certain. The broader issues 
      surrounding infrastructure, impacts on existing clinical care systems, and 
      regulatory concerns need to be considered for the implementation of Internet-based 
      RMSs in jurisdictions involving different clinical practices.

AB  - Plant stresses have been monitored using the imaging or spectrometry of plant leaves 
      in the visible (red-green-blue or RGB), near-infrared (NIR), infrared (IR), and 
      ultraviolet (UV) wavebands, often augmented by fluorescence imaging or fluorescence 
      spectrometry. Imaging at multiple specific wavelengths (multi-spectral imaging) or 
      across a wide range of wavelengths (hyperspectral imaging) can provide exceptional 
      information on plant stress and subsequent diseases. Digital cameras, thermal 
      cameras, and optical filters have become available at a low cost in recent years, 
      while hyperspectral cameras have become increasingly more compact and portable. 
      Furthermore, smartphone cameras have dramatically improved in quality, making them a 
      viable option for rapid, on-site stress detection. Due to these developments in 
      imaging technology, plant stresses can be monitored more easily using handheld and 
      field-deployable methods. Recent advances in machine learning algorithms have 
      allowed for images and spectra to be analyzed and classified in a fully automated 
      and reproducible manner, without the need for complicated image or spectrum analysis 
      methods. This review will highlight recent advances in portable (including 
      smartphone-based) detection methods for biotic and abiotic stresses, discuss data 
      processing and machine learning techniques that can produce results for stress 
      identification and classification, and suggest future directions towards the 
      successful translation of these methods into practical use.

AB  - RATIONALE: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic condition that has 
      wide-ranging negative effects on an individual's health and interpersonal 
      relationships. Treatments with long-term benefits are needed to promote the safety 
      and well-being of those suffering from PTSD. OBJECTIVES: To examine long-term change 
      in PTSD symptoms and additional benefits/harms after 
      3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy for treatment of 
      PTSD. METHODS: Participants received two to three active doses of MDMA (75-125 mg) 
      during blinded or open-label psychotherapy sessions with additional non-drug therapy 
      sessions. PTSD symptoms were assessed using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale 
      for DSM IV (CAPS-IV) at baseline, 1 to 2 months after the last active MDMA session 
      (treatment exit), and at least 12 months post final MDMA session (LTFU). A 
      mixed-effect repeated-measures (MMRM) analysis assessed changes in CAPS-IV total 
      severity scores. The number of participants who met PTSD diagnostic criteria was 
      summarized at each time point. Participants completed a long-term follow-up 
      questionnaire. RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in CAPS-IV total severity 
      scores from baseline to treatment exit (LS mean (SE) = - 44.8 (2.82), p < .0001), 
      with a Cohen's d effect size of 1.58 (95% CI = 1.24, 1.91). CAPS-IV scores continued 
      to decrease from treatment exit to LTFU (LS mean (SE) = - 5.2 (2.29), p < .05), with 
      a Cohen's d effect size of 0.23 (95% CI = 0.04, 0.43). The number of participants 
      who no longer met PTSD criteria increased from treatment exit (56.0%) to LTFU 
      (67.0%). The majority of participants reported benefits, including improved 
      relationships and well-being, and a minority reported harms from study 
      participation. CONCLUSIONS: PTSD symptoms were reduced 1 to 2 months after 
      MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, and symptom improvement continued at least 12 months 
      post-treatment. Phase 3 trials are investigating this novel treatment approach in a 
      larger sample of participants with chronic PTSD. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

      machine learning approach.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the greater sensitivity of the new dengue clinical 
      classification proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2009, there is a 
      need for a better definition of warning signs and clinical progression of dengue 
      cases. Classic statistical methods have been used to evaluate risk criteria in 
      dengue patients, however they usually cannot access the complexity of dengue 
      clinical profiles. We propose the use of machine learning as an alternative tool to 
      identify the possible characteristics that could be used to develop a risk criterion 
      for severity in dengue patients. METHOD: In this study, we analyzed the clinical 
      profiles of 523 confirmed dengue cases using self-organizing maps (SOM) and random 
      forest algorithms to identify clusters of patients with similar patterns. RESULTS: 
      We identified four natural clusters, two with features of dengue without warning 
      signs or mild disease, one that comprises the severe dengue cases and high frequency 
      of warning signs, and another with intermediate characteristics. Age appeared as the 
      key variable for splitting the data into these four clusters although warning signs 
      such as abdominal pain or tenderness, clinical fluid accumulation, mucosal bleeding, 
      lethargy, restlessness, liver enlargement and increased hematocrit associated with a 
      decrease in platelet counts should also be considered to evaluate severity in dengue 
      patients. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that age must be the first 
      characteristic to be considered in places where dengue is hyperendemic. Our results 
      show that warning signs should be closely monitored, mainly in children. Further 
      studies exploring these results in a longitudinal approach may help to understand 
      the full spectrum of dengue clinical manifestations.

AB  - There has been an increasing attention to the study of stress. Particularly, college 
      students often experience high levels of stress that are linked to several negative 
      outcomes concerning academic functioning, physical, and mental health. In this 
      paper, we introduce the EuStress Solution, that aims to create an Information System 
      to monitor and assess, continuously and in real-time, the stress levels of the 
      students in order to predict burnout. The Information System will use a measuring 
      instrument based on wearable device and machine learning techniques to collect and 
      process stress-related data from the students without their explicit interaction. In 
      the present study, we focus on heart rate and heart rate variability indices, by 
      comparing baseline and stress condition. We performed different statistical tests in 
      order to develop a complex and intelligent model. Results showed the neural network 
      had the better model fit.

      Data Analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
      pandemic has been growing exponentially, affecting over 4 million people and causing 
      enormous distress to economies and societies worldwide. A plethora of analyses based 
      on viral sequences has already been published both in scientific journals and 
      through non-peer-reviewed channels to investigate the genetic heterogeneity and 
      spatiotemporal dissemination of SARS-CoV-2. However, a systematic investigation of 
      phylogenetic information and sampling bias in the available data is lacking. 
      Although the number of available genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 is growing daily and 
      the sequences show increasing phylogenetic information, country-specific data still 
      present severe limitations and should be interpreted with caution. OBJECTIVE: The 
      objective of this study was to determine the quality of the currently available 
      SARS-CoV-2 full genome data in terms of sampling bias as well as phylogenetic and 
      temporal signals to inform and guide the scientific community. METHODS: We used 
      maximum likelihood-based methods to assess the presence of sufficient information 
      for robust phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies in several SARS-CoV-2 sequence 
      alignments assembled from GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data) 
      data released between March and April 2020. RESULTS: Although the number of 
      high-quality full genomes is growing daily, and sequence data released in April 2020 
      contain sufficient phylogenetic information to allow reliable inference of 
      phylogenetic relationships, country-specific SARS-CoV-2 data sets still present 
      severe limitations. CONCLUSIONS: At the present time, studies assessing 
      within-country spread or transmission clusters should be considered preliminary or 
      hypothesis-generating at best. Hence, current reports should be interpreted with 
      caution, and concerted efforts should continue to increase the number and quality of 
      sequences required for robust tracing of the epidemic.

LID - 19050
AB  - Cortisol is a biomarker for stress monitoring; however, the biomedical and clinical 
      relevance is still controversial due to the complexity of cortisol secretion 
      mechanisms and their circadian cycles as well as environmental factors that affect 
      physiological cortisol level, which include individual mood and dietary intake. To 
      further investigate this multifaceted relationship, a human pilot study examined 
      cortisol concentration in sweat and saliva samples collected from 48 college-aged 
      participants during aerobic exercise sessions along with mental distress and 
      nutrition surveys. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays determined highly significant 
      differences between apocrine-dominant sweat (AP), saliva before exercise (SBE), and 
      saliva after exercise (SAE) cortisol concentration (AP-SBE: p = 0.0017, AP-SAE: 
      p = 0.0102). A significantly greater AP cortisol concentration was detected in males 
      compared to females (p = 0.0559), and significant SAE cortisol concentration 
      differences were also recorded between recreational athletes and non-athletes 
      (p = 0.044). However, Kessler 10 Psychological Distress Scale (K10) scores, an 
      examination administered to deduce overall wellness, provided no significant 
      differences between males and females or athletes and non-athletes in distress 
      levels, which statistically signifies a direct relationship to cortisol was not 
      present. For further analysis, dietary intake from all participants was considered 
      to investigate whether a multiplexed association was prevalent between nutrition, 
      mood, and cortisol release. Significant positive correlations between AP cortisol, 
      SAE cortisol, K10 scores, and fat intake among female participants and athletes were 
      discovered. The various machine learning algorithms utilized the extensive 
      connections between dietary intake, overall well-being, sex factors, athletic 
      activity, and cortisol concentrations in various biofluids to predict K10 scores. 
      Indeed, the understanding of physiochemical stress response and the associations 
      between studied factors can advance algorithm developments for cortisol biosensing 
      systems to mitigate stress-based illnesses and improve an individual's quality of 
      life.

TI  - Instant Stress: Detection of Perceived Mental Stress Through Smartphone 
      Photoplethysmography and Thermal Imaging.
PG  - e10140
LID - 10.2196/10140 [doi]
LID - e10140
AB  - BACKGROUND: A smartphone is a promising tool for daily cardiovascular measurement 
      and mental stress monitoring. A smartphone camera-based photoplethysmography (PPG) 
      and a low-cost thermal camera can be used to create cheap, convenient, and mobile 
      monitoring systems. However, to ensure reliable monitoring results, a person must 
      remain still for several minutes while a measurement is being taken. This is 
      cumbersome and makes its use in real-life situations impractical. OBJECTIVE: We 
      proposed a system that combines PPG and thermography with the aim of improving 
      cardiovascular signal quality and detecting stress responses quickly. METHODS: Using 
      a smartphone camera with a low-cost thermal camera added on, we built a novel system 
      that continuously and reliably measures 2 different types of cardiovascular events: 
      (1) blood volume pulse and (2) vasoconstriction/dilation-induced temperature changes 
      of the nose tip. 17 participants, involved in stress-inducing mental workload tasks, 
      measured their physiological responses to stressors over a short time period (20 
      seconds) immediately after each task. Participants reported their perceived stress 
      levels on a 10-cm visual analog scale. For the instant stress inference task, we 
      built novel low-level feature sets representing cardiovascular variability. We then 
      used the automatic feature learning capability of artificial neural networks to 
      improve the mapping between the extracted features and the self-reported ratings. We 
      compared our proposed method with existing hand-engineered features-based machine 
      learning methods. RESULTS: First, we found that the measured PPG signals presented 
      high quality cardiac cyclic information (mean pSQI: 0.755; SD 0.068). We also found 
      that the measured thermal changes of the nose tip presented high-quality breathing 
      cyclic information and filtering helped extract vasoconstriction/dilation-induced 
      patterns with fewer respiratory effects (mean pSQI: from 0.714 to 0.157). Second, we 
      found low correlations between the self-reported stress scores and the existing 
      metrics of the cardiovascular signals (ie, heart rate variability and thermal 
      directionality) from short measurements, suggesting they were not very dependent 
      upon one another. Third, we tested the performance of the instant perceived stress 
      inference method. The proposed method achieved significantly higher accuracies than 
      existing precrafted features-based methods. In addition, the 17-fold 
      leave-one-subject-out cross-validation results showed that combining both modalities 
      produced higher accuracy than using PPG or thermal imaging only (PPG+Thermal: 
      78.33%; PPG: 68.53%; Thermal: 58.82%). The multimodal results are comparable to the 
      state-of-the-art stress recognition methods that require long-term measurements. 
      Finally, we explored effects of different data labeling strategies on the 
      sensitivity of our inference methods. Our results showed the need for separation of 
      and normalization between individual data. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate the 
      feasibility of using smartphone-based imaging for instant stress detection. Given 
      that this approach does not need long-term measurements requiring attention and 
      reduced mobility, we believe it is more suitable for mobile mental health care 
      solutions in the wild.

AB  - We have developed a system with multimodality that monitors objective biomarkers for 
      screening the mental distress in the office. A field study using a prototype of the 
      system was performed over four months with 39 volunteers. We obtained PC operation 
      patterns using a PC logger, sleeping time and activity levels using a 
      wrist-band-type activity tracker, and brain activity and behavior data during a 
      working memory task using optical topography. We also administered two standard 
      questionnaires: the Brief Job Stress Questionnaire (BJS) and the Kessler 6 scale 
      (K6). Supervised machine learning and cross validation were performed. The objective 
      variables were mental scores obtained from the questionnaires and the explanatory 
      variables were the biomarkers obtained from the modalities. Multiple linear 
      regression models for mental scores were comprehensively searched and the optimum 
      models were selected from 2,619,785 candidates. Each mental score estimated with 
      each optimum model was well correlated with each mental score obtained with the 
      questionnaire (correlation coefficient = 0.6-0.8) within a 24% of estimation error. 
      Mental scores obtained by means of questionnaires have been in general use in mental 
      health care for a while, so our multimodality system is potentially useful for 
      mental healthcare due to the quantitative agreement on the mental scores estimated 
      with biomarkers and the mental scores obtained with questionnaires.

AB  - Evaluation of cardiac function during periods of stress is of key importance for the 
      perioperative setting. Non-invasive hemodynamic monitors provide markers of cardiac 
      function. This pilot study sought to evaluate the ability of a non-invasive 
      hemodynamic monitor to detect cardiac stress during formal stress echocardiography 
      testing. The primary goal was to compare the change in hemodynamic values during the 
      pre/during/post phases of stress echocardiography testing in patients who had 
      results negative versus positive for myocardial ischemia. Adult patients scheduled 
      for outpatient cardiac stress testing were screened. Only patients scheduled for 
      stress-echocardiography testing were consented. Patients with history of arrhythmias 
      were excluded. During the testing, patients wore a cuff-based hemodynamic sensor 
      (Nexfin system, Edwards Lifesciences). Data from the hemodynamic sensor were 
      compared to the findings of the stress study. A total of 37 patients were enrolled, 
      with 31 patients included for analysis. Five patients had stress studies positive 
      for coronary ischemia. Comparison of the hemodynamic variables between patients who 
      had a positive stress study versus negative showed a significant reduction in the 
      percentage change in dP/dt and stroke volume from baseline (p < 0.05). This pilot 
      study indicates that patients who have abnormal stress echocardiograms also have 
      significantly reduced values from a noninvasive hemodynamic monitor. Further 
      evaluation of the clinical utility of this technology, to assist in the care of 
      patients at risk for cardiac ischemia, should be carried out.

TI  - Machine-Learning-Based Approach to Decode the Influence of Nanomaterial Properties 
      on Their Interaction with Cells.
PG  - 1943-1955
LID - 10.1021/acsami.0c18470 [doi]
AB  - In an in vitro nanotoxicity system, cell-nanoparticle (NP) interaction leads to the 
      surface adsorption, uptake, and changes into nuclei/cell phenotype and chemistry, as 
      an indicator of oxidative stress, genotoxicity, and carcinogenicity. Different types 
      of nanomaterials and their chemical composition or "corona" have been widely studied 
      in context with nanotoxicology. However, rare reports are available, which delineate 
      the details of the cell shape index (CSI) and nuclear area factors (NAFs) as a 
      descriptor of the type of nanomaterials. In this paper, we propose a 
      machine-learning-based graph modeling and correlation-establishing approach using 
      tight junction protein ZO-1-mediated alteration in the cell/nuclei phenotype to 
      quantify and propose it as indices of cell-NP interactions. We believe that the 
      phenotypic variation (CSI and NAF) in the epithelial cell is governed by the 
      physicochemical descriptors (e.g., shape, size, zeta potential, concentration, 
      diffusion coefficients, polydispersity, and so on) of the different classes of 
      nanomaterials, which critically determines the intracellular uptake or cell membrane 
      interactions when exposed to the epithelial cells at sub-lethal concentrations. The 
      intrinsic and extrinsic physicochemical properties of the representative 
      nanomaterials (NMs) were measured using optical (dynamic light scattering, NP 
      tracking analysis) methods to create a set of nanodescriptors contributing to 
      cell-NM interactions via phenotype adjustments. We used correlation function as a 
      machine-learning algorithm to successfully predict cell and nuclei shapes and 
      polarity functions as phenotypic markers for five different classes of nanomaterials 
      studied herein this report. The CSI and NAF as nanodescriptors can be used as 
      intuitive cell phenotypic parameters to define the safety of nanomaterials 
      extensively used in consumer products and nanomedicine.

AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) implicates a huge burden for patients and society. 
      Although currently available antidepressants are effective treatment options, more 
      than 50% of the patients do not respond to the first administered antidepressant. In 
      addition, in more than 25% with antidepressants-treated patients, adverse effects 
      occur. Currently, the selection of treatment does not reflect objectively measurable 
      data from neurobiological and behavioral systems. However, in the last decades, the 
      understanding of the impact of genetic variants on clinical features such as drug 
      metabolism has grown and can be used to develop tests that enable a patient-tailored 
      individual treatment. In fact, robust evidence was found that genetic variants of 
      CYP450 enzymes such as CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 can be surrogate markers for the 
      metabolism of certain drugs. This article describes a pilot study design aimed to 
      combine clinical variables such as therapeutic drug monitoring, inflammatory and 
      stress markers with static and variable genetic information of depressed patients to 
      develop an algorithm that predicts treatment response, and tolerability using 
      machine learning algorithms. Psychometric evaluation covers the Hamilton Depression 
      Rating Scale, the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, and adverse drug reactions. An 
      in-depth (epi-)genetic assessment combines genome-wide gene association data with 
      DNA methylation patterns of genes coding CYP enzymes along with a pharmacogenetic 
      battery focusing on CYP enzymes. Using these measures to stratify depressed 
      patients, this approach should contribute to a data-driven assessment and management 
      of MDD, which can be referred to as precision medicine or high-definition medicine.

LID - e0225592
AB  - Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) allows contactless monitoring of human cardiac 
      activity through a video camera. In this study, we assessed the accuracy and 
      precision for heart rate measurements of the only consumer product available on the 
      market, namely the FacereaderTM rPPG by Noldus, with respect to a gold standard 
      electrocardiograph. Twenty-four healthy participants were asked to sit in front of a 
      computer screen and alternate two periods of rest with two stress tests (i.e. 
      Go/No-Go task), while their heart rate was simultaneously acquired for 20 minutes 
      using the ECG criterion measure and the FacereaderTM rPPG. Results show that the 
      FacereaderTM rPPG tends to overestimate lower heart rates and underestimate higher 
      heart rates compared to the ECG. The Facereader™ rPPG revealed a mean bias of 9.8 
      bpm, the 95% limits of agreement (LoA) ranged from almost -30 up to +50 bpm. These 
      results suggest that whilst the rPPG FacereaderTM technology has potential for 
      contactless heart rate monitoring, its predictions are inaccurate for higher heart 
      rates, with unacceptable precision across the entire range, rendering its estimates 
      unreliable for monitoring individuals.

TI  - A Deep-Learning Model for Subject-Independent Human Emotion Recognition Using 
      Electrodermal Activity Sensors.
LID - 10.3390/s19071659 [doi]
LID - 1659
AB  - One of the main objectives of Active and Assisted Living (AAL) environments is to 
      ensure that elderly and/or disabled people perform/live well in their immediate 
      environments; this can be monitored by among others the recognition of emotions 
      based on non-highly intrusive sensors such as Electrodermal Activity (EDA) sensors. 
      However, designing a learning system or building a machine-learning model to 
      recognize human emotions while training the system on a specific group of persons 
      and testing the system on a totally a new group of persons is still a serious 
      challenge in the field, as it is possible that the second testing group of persons 
      may have different emotion patterns. Accordingly, the purpose of this paper is to 
      contribute to the field of human emotion recognition by proposing a Convolutional 
      Neural Network (CNN) architecture which ensures promising robustness-related results 
      for both subject-dependent and subject-independent human emotion recognition. The 
      CNN model has been trained using a grid search technique which is a model 
      hyperparameter optimization technique to fine-tune the parameters of the proposed 
      CNN architecture. The overall concept's performance is validated and stress-tested 
      by using MAHNOB and DEAP datasets. The results demonstrate a promising robustness 
      improvement regarding various evaluation metrics. We could increase the accuracy for 
      subject-independent classification to 78% and 82% for MAHNOB and DEAP respectively 
      and to 81% and 85% subject-dependent classification for MAHNOB and DEAP respectively 
      (4 classes/labels). The work shows clearly that while using solely the non-intrusive 
      EDA sensors a robust classification of human emotion is possible even without 
      involving additional/other physiological signals.

AB  - Genomic breeding programs have been paramount in improving the rates of genetic 
      progress of productive efficiency traits in livestock. Such improvement has been 
      accompanied by the intensification of production systems, use of a wider range of 
      precision technologies in routine management practices, and high-throughput 
      phenotyping. Simultaneously, a greater public awareness of animal welfare has 
      influenced livestock producers to place more emphasis on welfare relative to 
      production traits. Therefore, management practices and breeding technologies in 
      livestock have been developed in recent years to enhance animal welfare. In 
      particular, genomic selection can be used to improve livestock social behavior, 
      resilience to disease and other stress factors, and ease habituation to production 
      system changes. The main requirements for including novel behavioral and welfare 
      traits in genomic breeding schemes are: (1) to identify traits that represent the 
      biological mechanisms of the industry breeding goals; (2) the availability of 
      individual phenotypic records measured on a large number of animals (ideally with 
      genomic information); (3) the derived traits are heritable, biologically meaningful, 
      repeatable, and (ideally) not highly correlated with other traits already included 
      in the selection indexes; and (4) genomic information is available for a large 
      number of individuals (or genetically close individuals) with phenotypic records. In 
      this review, we (1) describe a potential route for development of novel welfare 
      indicator traits (using ideal phenotypes) for both genetic and genomic selection 
      schemes; (2) summarize key indicator variables of livestock behavior and welfare, 
      including a detailed assessment of thermal stress in livestock; (3) describe the 
      primary statistical and bioinformatic methods available for large-scale data 
      analyses of animal welfare; and (4) identify major advancements, challenges, and 
      opportunities to generate high-throughput and large-scale datasets to enable genetic 
      and genomic selection for improved welfare in livestock. A wide variety of novel 
      welfare indicator traits can be derived from information captured by modern 
      technology such as sensors, automatic feeding systems, milking robots, activity 
      monitors, video cameras, and indirect biomarkers at the cellular and physiological 
      levels. The development of novel traits coupled with genomic selection schemes for 
      improved welfare in livestock can be feasible and optimized based on recently 
      developed (or developing) technologies. Efficient implementation of genetic and 
      genomic selection for improved animal welfare also requires the integration of a 
      multitude of scientific fields such as cell and molecular biology, neuroscience, 
      immunology, stress physiology, computer science, engineering, quantitative genomics, 
      and bioinformatics.

AB  - Video tracking based biological early warning system achieved a great progress with 
      advanced computer vision and machine learning methods. Ability of video tracking of 
      multiple biological organisms has been largely improved in recent years. Video based 
      behavioral monitoring has become a common tool for acquiring quantified behavioral 
      data for aquatic risk assessment. Investigation of behavioral responses under 
      chemical and environmental stress has been boosted by rapidly developed machine 
      learning and artificial intelligence. In this paper, we introduce the fundamental of 
      video tracking and present the pioneer works in precise tracking of a group of 
      individuals in 2D and 3D space. Technical and practical issues suffered in video 
      tracking are explained. Subsequently, the toxic analysis based on fish behavioral 
      data is summarized. Frequently used computational methods and machine learning are 
      explained with their applications in aquatic toxicity detection and abnormal pattern 
      analysis. Finally, advantages of recent developed deep learning approach in toxic 
      prediction are presented.

TI  - Web-Based Intervention Using Behavioral Activation and Physical Activity for Adults 
      With Depression (The eMotion Study): Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - e10112
LID - 10.2196/10112 [doi]
LID - e10112
AB  - BACKGROUND: Physical activity is a potentially effective treatment for depression 
      and depressive relapse. However, promoting physical activity in people with 
      depression is challenging. Interventions informed by theory and evidence are 
      therefore needed to support people with depression to become more physically active. 
      eMotion is a Web-based intervention combining behavioral activation and physical 
      activity promotion for people in the community with symptoms of depression. 
      OBJECTIVE: The objectives were to assess the feasibility and acceptability of 
      delivering eMotion to people in the community with symptoms of depression and to 
      explore outcomes. METHODS: Participants with elevated depressive symptoms were 
      recruited from the community through various methods (eg, social media) and 
      randomized to eMotion or a waiting list control group for 8 weeks. eMotion is an 
      administratively supported weekly modular program that helps people use key behavior 
      change techniques (eg, graded tasks, action planning, and self-monitoring) to 
      re-engage in routine, pleasurable, and necessary activities, with a focus on 
      physical activities. Feasibility data were collected that included the following: 
      recruitment and trial retention rates; fidelity of intervention delivery, receipt, 
      and enactment; and acceptability of the intervention and data collection procedures. 
      Data were collected for the primary (depression) and secondary outcomes (eg, 
      anxiety, physical activity, fidelity, and client satisfaction) at baseline and 2 
      months postrandomization using self-reported Web-based questionnaires and 
      accelerometers. Delivery fidelity (logins, modules accessed, time spent) was tracked 
      using Web usage statistics. Exploratory analyses were conducted on the primary and 
      secondary outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 183 people who contacted the research team, 62 
      were recruited and randomized. The mean baseline score was 14.6 (SD 3.2) on the 
      8-item Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale (PHQ-8). Of those randomized, 
      52 participants provided accelerometer-recorded physical activity data at baseline 
      that showed a median of 35.8 (interquartile range [IQR] 0.0-98.6) minutes of 
      moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) recorded in at least 10-minute bouts 
      per week, with only 13% (7/52) people achieving guideline levels (150 minutes of 
      MVPA per week). In total, 81% (50/62) of participants provided follow-up data for 
      the primary outcome (PHQ-8), but only 39% (24/62) provided follow-up accelerometer 
      data. Within the intervention group, the median number of logins, modules accessed, 
      and total minutes spent on eMotion was 3 (IQR 2.0-8.0), 3 (IQR 2.0-5.0), and 41.3 
      (IQR 18.9-90.4), respectively. Acceptability was mixed. Exploratory data analysis 
      showed that PHQ-8 levels were lower for the intervention group than for the control 
      group at 2 months postrandomization (adjusted mean difference -3.6, 95% CI -6.1 to 
      -1.1). CONCLUSIONS: It was feasible to deliver eMotion in UK communities to inactive 
      populations. eMotion has the potential to be effective and is ready for testing in a 
      full-scale trial. Further work is needed to improve engagement with both the 
      intervention and data collection procedures. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov

TI  - Benthic diatoms as bioindicators of environmental alterations in different 
      watercourses of northern Italy.
PG  - 158
LID - 10.1007/s10661-019-7290-x [doi]
AB  - This work aims to evaluate the effects of different environmental factors (i.e., 
      geographical, chemical, and hydrological) on benthic diatoms at 34 sites located in 
      13 watercourses of northern Italy, and to highlight possible misclassifications of 
      the ecological status of watercourses, sensu Water Framework Directive, related to 
      the normative index currently adopted in Italy (ICMi). The analysis of both the 
      taxonomical and functional composition of diatom communities confirmed the presence 
      of differences in terms of taxonomical richness, diversity, and taxa assemblages, 
      associated to the altitude and the geological characteristics of the investigated 
      watercourses. Moreover, the data analysis revealed differences due to chemical and 
      hydrological alterations. Specifically, our results showed a clear link among these 
      environmental perturbations and the communities' functional composition expressed 
      through the use of ecological guilds. High abundance and richness of motile diatoms 
      were detected in sites characterized by nutrient enrichment, while high abundance of 
      low-profile diatoms was linked to hydrological alteration. In contrast, these 
      anthropogenic perturbations were not detected by the ICMi, which ranked more than 
      90% of the analyzed samples in the highest quality class. This study stresses the 
      need for a different approach in diatom data interpretation in order to achieve 
      reliable information about the ecological status of watercourses.

      disability; however, current MDD diagnosis methods lack an objective assessment of 
      depressive symptoms. Here, a machine learning approach to separate MDD patients from 
      healthy controls was developed based on linear and nonlinear heart rate variability 
      (HRV), which reflects the autonomic cardiovascular regulation. METHODS: HRV data 
      were collected from 37 MDD patients and 41 healthy controls during five 5-min 
      experimental phases: the baseline, a mental stress task, stress recovery, a 
      relaxation task, and relaxation task recovery. The experimental protocol was 
      designed to assess the autonomic responses to stress and recovery. Twenty HRV 
      indices were extracted from each phase, and a total of 100 features were used for 
      classification using a support vector machine (SVM). SVM-recursive feature 
      elimination (RFE) and statistical filter were employed to perform feature selection. 
      RESULTS: We achieved 74.4% accuracy, 73% sensitivity, and 75.6% specificity with two 
      optimal features selected by SVM-RFE, which were extracted from the stress task 
      recovery and mental stress phases. Classification performance worsened when 
      individual phases were used separately as input data, compared to when all phases 
      were included. The SVM-RFE using nonlinear and Poincaré plot HRV features performed 
      better than that using the linear indices and matched the best performance achieved 
      by using all features. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the machine learning-based 
      diagnosis of MDD using HRV analysis. Monitoring the changes in linear and nonlinear 
      HRV features for various autonomic nervous system states can facilitate the more 
      objective identification of MDD patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Motor and non-motor behavior analyses are increasingly utilizied in drug 
      discovery and screening, detection of neurobehavioral disorders and chemical 
      toxicology. The emergence of computational approaches has helped to develop 
      different tools to analyse complex behaviors. Analysis of locomotor behavior helps 
      in understanding the motor neuron disorders like Parkinson's Disease. Although many 
      animal models are available to study the locomotion, adult zebrafish has emerged as 
      a simple and efficient model to study this behavior. An inexpensive and easily 
      customizable tool is required to replace the licensed and expensive set-up to 
      analyse the locomotor behavior. NEW METHOD: In this study we have optimized the 
      ImageJ plugin wrMTrck to analyse motor and non-motor behaviors in adult zebrafish. 
      We have generated a macro to simplify the preprocessing and tracking. Subsequently, 
      we have developed a data analysis sheet to analyse various behavioral end points. 
      RESULTS: We have successfully developed an inexpensive video acquisition set-up and 
      optimized wrMTrck for adult zebrafish. In order to demonstrate the efficacy of this 
      method, adult zebrafish were injected with MPTP and motor and non-motor behaviors 
      were analysed. Expectedly, MPTP injected fish showed decrease in dopamine level and 
      dat expression level, which subsequently led to locomotor behavioral defects as well 
      as anxiety, a non-motor symptom of PD. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD(S): Further, 
      the obtained results were validated by another ImageJ macro developed by Pelkowski 
      et al. (2011) and we observed identical trajectories. CONCLUSIONS: The usefulness of 
      popular ImageJ plugin wrMTrck and this extended protocol will be helpful to quantify 
      motor and non-motor behavioral parameters.

TI  - Rapid breath analysis for acute respiratory distress syndrome diagnostics using a 
      portable two-dimensional gas chromatography device.
PG  - 6435-6447

AB  - Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the most severe form of acute lung 
      injury, responsible for high mortality and long-term morbidity. As a dynamic 
      syndrome with multiple etiologies, its timely diagnosis is difficult as is tracking 
      the course of the syndrome. Therefore, there is a significant need for early, rapid 
      detection and diagnosis as well as clinical trajectory monitoring of ARDS. Here, we 
      report our work on using human breath to differentiate ARDS and non-ARDS causes of 
      respiratory failure. A fully automated portable 2-dimensional gas chromatography 
      device with high peak capacity (> 200 at the resolution of 1), high sensitivity 
      (sub-ppb), and rapid analysis capability (~ 30 min) was designed and made in-house 
      for on-site analysis of patients' breath. A total of 85 breath samples from 48 ARDS 
      patients and controls were collected. Ninety-seven elution peaks were separated and 
      detected in 13 min. An algorithm based on machine learning, principal component 
      analysis (PCA), and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was developed. As compared to 
      the adjudications done by physicians based on the Berlin criteria, our device and 
      algorithm achieved an overall accuracy of 87.1% with 94.1% positive predictive value 
      and 82.4% negative predictive value. The high overall accuracy and high positive 
      predicative value suggest that the breath analysis method can accurately diagnose 
      ARDS. The ability to continuously and non-invasively monitor exhaled breath for 
      early diagnosis, disease trajectory tracking, and outcome prediction monitoring of 
      ARDS may have a significant impact on changing practice and improving patient 
      outcomes. Graphical abstract.

LID - 10.3390/plants9111626 [doi]
LID - 1626
AB  - Seeds germination and seedlings growth of Cucumis sativus and Solanum lycopersicum 
      were monitored in in vitro and in vivo experiments after application of different 
      concentrations of NaCl (25, 50, 100 and 200 mM). Photosynthetic pigments content and 
      the biochemical responses of C. sativus and S. lycopersicum were assessed. Salinity 
      stress slightly delayed the seeds germination rate and significantly reduced the 
      percentage of germination as well as shoot length under the highest salt 
      concentration (200 mM) in cucumber. Furthermore, root length was decreased 
      significantly in all treatments. Whereas, in tomato, a prominent delay in seeds 
      germination rate, the germination percentage and seedlings growth (shoot and root 
      lengths) were significantly influenced under all concentrations of NaCl. Fresh and 
      dry weights were reduced prominently in tomato compared to cucumber. Photosynthetic 
      pigments content was reduced but with pronounced decreasing in tomato compared to 
      cucumber. Secondary metabolites profiling in both plants under stress was varied 
      from tomato to cucumber. The content of saponins, proline and total antioxidant 
      capacity was reduced more prominently in tomato as compared to cucumber. On the 
      other hand, the content of phenolics and flavonoids was increased in both plants 
      with pronounced increase in tomato particularly under the highest level of salinity 
      stress. The metabolomic profiling in stressful plants was significantly influenced 
      by salinity stress and some bioactive secondary metabolites was enhanced in both 
      cucumber and tomato plants. The enhancement of secondary metabolites under salinity 
      stress may explain the tolerance and sensitivity of cucumber and tomato under 
      salinity stress. The metabolomic evaluation combined with multivariate data analysis 
      revealed a similar mechanism of action of plants to mediate stress, with variant 
      level of this response in both plant species. Based on these results, the effect of 
      salinity stress on seeds germination, seedlings growth and metabolomic content of 
      plants was discussed in terms of tolerance and sensitivity of plants to salinity 
      stress.

LID - 10.1002/JLB.5A0820-436R [doi]
AB  - The amplitude of the innate immune response reflects the degree of physiological 
      stress imposed by exercise load. An optimal balance of exercise intensity and 
      duration is essential for a balanced immune system and reduces the risk of 
      dysfunction of the immune system. Therefore, it is hypothesized that neutrophils, as 
      key players in the innate immune system, can be used as biomarker in detecting 
      overtraining. The aim was to monitor the state of the innate immune system by 
      phenotyping neutrophils during consecutive bouts of prolonged exercise. Study 
      subjects were recruited from a cohort of walkers participating in a walking event on 
      3 consecutive days. Participants with immune deficiencies were excluded. 
      Questionnaires to determine the physiological status of the participants were 
      completed. Analysis of neutrophil receptor expression was done by a point-of-care 
      fully automated flow cytometer. A total of 45 participants were recruited, of whom 
      39 participants were included for data analysis. Study participants had a median age 
      of 64 (58-70) years. The absolute numbers CD16(dim) /CD62L(bright) and CD16(bright) 
      /CD62L(dim) neutrophils were increased after the first 2 days of exercise followed 
      by an adaptation/normalization after the third day. Participants with activated 
      neutrophils (high CD11b expression) had an impaired physical feeling indicated by 
      the participant on a lower visual analog scale compared to participants who did not 
      have activated neutrophils (P = 0.017, P = 0.022). Consecutive days of prolonged 
      exercise results in an initial systemic innate immune response, followed by 
      normalization/adaptation. Increased neutrophil activation was associated with 
      impaired physical feeling measured by a validated VAS score indicated by the 
      participant. Fully automated point-of-care flow cytometry analysis of neutrophil 
      phenotypes in a field laboratory might be a useful tool to monitor relevant 
      differences in the systemic innate immune response in response to exercise.

TI  - Urban Emotion Sensing Beyond 'Affective Capture': Advancing Critical 
      Interdisciplinary Methods.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph17239003 [doi]
LID - 9003
AB  - The use of mobile sensor methodologies in urban analytics to study 'urban emotions' 
      is currently outpacing the science required to rigorously interpret the data 
      generated. Interdisciplinary research on 'urban stress' could help inform urban 
      wellbeing policies relating to healthier commuting and alleviation of work stress. 
      The purpose of this paper is to address-through methodological 
      experimentation-ethical, political and conceptual issues identified by critical 
      social scientists with regards to emotion tracking, wearables and data analytics. We 
      aim to encourage more dialogue between the critical approach and applied 
      environmental health research. The definition of stress is not unambiguous or 
      neutral and is mediated by the very technologies we use for research. We outline an 
      integrative methodology in which we combine pilot field research using biosensing 
      technologies, a novel method for identifying 'moments of stress' in a laboratory 
      setting, psychometric surveys and narrative interviews on workplace and commuter 
      stress in urban environments.

TI  - Prediction and network modelling of self-harm through daily self-report and history 
      of self-injury.
PG  - 1-11
LID - 10.1017/S0033291720000744 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Self-harm is a significant public health issue, and both our 
      understanding and ability to predict adverse outcomes are currently inadequate. The 
      current study explores how preventative efforts could be aided through short-term 
      prediction and modelling of risk factors for self-harm. METHODS: Patients (72% 
      female, Mage = 40.3 years) within an inpatient psychiatric facility self-reported 
      their psychological distress, interpersonal circumstances, and wish to live and die 
      on a daily basis during 3690 unique admissions. Hierarchical logistic regressions 
      assessed whether daily changes in self-report and history of self-harm could predict 
      self-harm, with machine learning used to train and test the model. To assess 
      interrelationships between predictors, network and cross-lagged panel models were 
      performed. RESULTS: Increases in a wish to die (β = 1.34) and psychological distress 
      (β = 1.07) on a daily basis were associated with increased rates of self-harm, while 
      a wish to die on the day prior [odds ratio (OR) 3.02] and a history of self-harm (OR 
      3.02) was also associated with self-harm. The model detected 77.7% of self-harm 
      incidents (positive predictive value = 26.6%, specificity = 79.1%). Psychological 
      distress, wish to live and die, and interpersonal factors were reciprocally related 
      over the prior day. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term fluctuations in self-reported mental 
      health may provide an indication of when an individual is at-risk of self-harm. 
      Routine monitoring may provide useful feedback to clinical staff to reduce risk of 
      self-harm. Modifiable risk factors identified in the current study may be targeted 
      during interventions to minimise risk of self-harm.

TI  - Predicting tachycardia as a surrogate for instability in the intensive care unit.
PG  - 973-985
LID - 10.1007/s10877-019-00277-0 [doi]
AB  - Tachycardia is a strong though non-specific marker of cardiovascular stress that 
      proceeds hemodynamic instability. We designed a predictive model of tachycardia 
      using multi-granular intensive care unit (ICU) data by creating a risk score and 
      dynamic trajectory. A subset of clinical and numerical signals were extracted from 
      the Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care II database. A 
      tachycardia episode was defined as heart rate ≥ 130/min lasting for ≥ 5 min, with 
      ≥ 10% density. Regularized logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF) 
      classifiers were trained to create a risk score for upcoming tachycardia. Three 
      different risk score models were compared for tachycardia and control 
      (non-tachycardia) groups. Risk trajectory was generated from time windows moving 
      away at 1 min increments from the tachycardia episode. Trajectories were computed 
      over 3 hours leading up to the episode for three different models. From 2809 
      subjects, 787 tachycardia episodes and 707 control periods were identified. Patients 
      with tachycardia had increased vasopressor support, longer ICU stay, and increased 
      ICU mortality than controls. In model evaluation, RF was slightly superior to LR, 
      which accuracy ranged from 0.847 to 0.782, with area under the curve from 0.921 to 
      0.842. Risk trajectory analysis showed average risks for tachycardia group evolved 
      to 0.78 prior to the tachycardia episodes, while control group risks remained < 0.3. 
      Among the three models, the internal control model demonstrated evolving trajectory 
      approximately 75 min before tachycardia episode. Clinically relevant tachycardia 
      episodes can be predicted from vital sign time series using machine learning 
      algorithms.

AB  - The proliferation of mobile, online, and remote monitoring technologies in digital 
      geriatric mental health has the potential to lead to the next major breakthrough in 
      mental health treatments. Unlike traditional mental health services, digital 
      geriatric mental health has the benefit of serving a large number of older adults, 
      and in many instances, does not rely on mental health clinics to offer real-time 
      interventions. As technology increasingly becomes essential in the everyday lives of 
      older adults with mental health conditions, these technologies will provide a 
      fundamental service delivery strategy to support older adults' mental health 
      recovery. Although ample research on digital geriatric mental health is available, 
      fundamental gaps in the scientific literature still exist. To begin to address these 
      gaps, we propose the following recommendations for a future research agenda: 1) 
      additional proof-of-concept studies are needed; 2) integrating engineering 
      principles in methodologically rigorous research may help science keep pace with 
      technology; 3) studies are needed that identify implementation issues; 4) 
      inclusivity of people with a lived experience of a mental health condition can offer 
      valuable perspectives and new insights; and 5) formation of a workgroup specific for 
      digital geriatric mental health to set standards and principles for research and 
      practice. We propose prioritizing the advancement of digital geriatric mental health 
      research in several areas that are of great public health significance, including 1) 
      simultaneous and integrated treatment of physical health and mental health 
      conditions; 2) effectiveness studies that explore diagnostics and treatment of 
      social determinants of health such as "social isolation" and "loneliness;" and 3) 
      tailoring the development and testing of innovative strategies to minority older 
      adult populations.

AB  - Cardiorespiratory monitoring is crucial for the diagnosis and management of multiple 
      conditions such as stress and sleep disorders. Therefore, the development of 
      ambulatory systems providing continuous, comfortable, and inexpensive means for 
      monitoring represents an important research topic. Several techniques have been 
      proposed in the literature to derive respiratory information from the ECG signal. 
      Ten methods to compute single-lead ECG-derived respiration (EDR) were compared under 
      multiple conditions, including different recording systems, baseline wander, normal 
      and abnormal breathing patterns, changes in breathing rate, noise, and artifacts. 
      Respiratory rates, wave morphology, and cardiorespiratory information were derived 
      from the ECG and compared to those extracted from a reference respiratory signal. 
      Three datasets were considered for analysis, involving a total 59 482 one-min, 
      single-lead ECG segments recorded from 156 subjects. The results indicate that the 
      methods based on QRS slopes outperform the other methods. This result is 
      particularly interesting since simplicity is crucial for the development of 
      ECG-based ambulatory systems.

TI  - Blood Uric Acid Prediction With Machine Learning: Model Development and Performance 
      Comparison.
PG  - e18331
LID - 10.2196/18331 [doi]
LID - e18331
AB  - BACKGROUND: Uric acid is associated with noncommunicable diseases such as 
      cardiovascular diseases, chronic kidney disease, coronary artery disease, stroke, 
      diabetes, metabolic syndrome, vascular dementia, and hypertension. Therefore, uric 
      acid is considered to be a risk factor for the development of noncommunicable 
      diseases. Most studies on uric acid have been performed in developed countries, and 
      the application of machine-learning approaches in uric acid prediction in developing 
      countries is rare. Different machine-learning algorithms will work differently on 
      different types of data in various diseases; therefore, a different investigation is 
      needed for different types of data to identify the most accurate algorithms. 
      Specifically, no study has yet focused on the urban corporate population in 
      Bangladesh, despite the high risk of developing noncommunicable diseases for this 
      population. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a model for predicting 
      blood uric acid values based on basic health checkup test results, dietary 
      information, and sociodemographic characteristics using machine-learning algorithms. 
      The prediction of health checkup test measurements can be very helpful to reduce 
      health management costs. METHODS: Various machine-learning approaches were used in 
      this study because clinical input data are not completely independent and exhibit 
      complex interactions. Conventional statistical models have limitations to consider 
      these complex interactions, whereas machine learning can consider all possible 
      interactions among input data. We used boosted decision tree regression, decision 
      forest regression, Bayesian linear regression, and linear regression to predict 
      personalized blood uric acid based on basic health checkup test results, dietary 
      information, and sociodemographic characteristics. We evaluated the performance of 
      these five widely used machine-learning models using data collected from 271 
      employees in the Grameen Bank complex of Dhaka, Bangladesh. RESULTS: The mean uric 
      acid level was 6.63 mg/dL, indicating a borderline result for the majority of the 
      sample (normal range <7.0 mg/dL). Therefore, these individuals should be monitoring 
      their uric acid regularly. The boosted decision tree regression model showed the 
      best performance among the models tested based on the root mean squared error of 
      0.03, which is also better than that of any previously reported model. CONCLUSIONS: 
      A uric acid prediction model was developed based on personal characteristics, 
      dietary information, and some basic health checkup measurements. This model will be 
      useful for improving awareness among high-risk individuals and populations, which 
      can help to save medical costs. A future study could include additional features 
      (eg, work stress, daily physical activity, alcohol intake, eating red meat) in 
      improving prediction.

LID - 59
AB  - BACKGROUND: Elevated and prolonged exposure to extreme heat is an important cause of 
      excess summertime mortality and morbidity. To protect people from health threats, 
      some governments are currently operating syndromic surveillance systems. However, A 
      lack of resources to support time- and labor- intensive diagnostic and reporting 
      processes make it difficult establishing region-specific surveillance systems. Big 
      data created by social media and web search may improve upon the current syndromic 
      surveillance systems by directly capturing people's individual and subjective 
      thoughts and feelings during heat waves. This study aims to investigate the 
      relationship between heat-related web searches, social media messages, and 
      heat-related health outcomes. METHODS: We collected Twitter messages that mentioned 
      "air conditioning (AC)" and "heat" and Google search data that included weather, 
      medical, recreational, and adaptation information from May 7 to November 3, 2014, 
      focusing on the state of Florida, U.S. We separately associated web data against two 
      different sources of health outcomes (emergency department (ED) and hospital 
      admissions) and five disease categories (cardiovascular disease, dehydration, 
      heat-related illness, renal disease, and respiratory disease). Seasonal and 
      subseasonal temporal cycles were controlled using autoregressive moving 
      average-generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARMA-GARCH) and 
      generalized linear model (GLM). RESULTS: The results show that the number of 
      heat-related illness and dehydration cases exhibited a significant positive 
      relationship with web data. Specifically, heat-related illness cases showed positive 
      associations with messages (heat, AC) and web searches (drink, heat stroke, park, 
      swim, and tired). In addition, terms such as park, pool, swim, and water tended to 
      show a consistent positive relationship with dehydration cases. However, we found 
      inconsistent relationships between renal illness and web data. Web data also did not 
      improve the models for cardiovascular and respiratory illness cases. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Our findings suggest web data created by social medias and search engines could 
      improve the current syndromic surveillance systems. In particular, heat-related 
      illness and dehydration cases were positively related with web data. This paper also 
      shows that activity patterns for reducing heat stress are associated with several 
      health outcomes. Based on the results, we believe web data could benefit both 
      regions without the systems and persistently hot and humid climates where excess 
      heat early warning systems may be less effective.

AB  - Ecosystems and the communities they support are changing at alarmingly rapid rates. 
      Tracking species diversity is vital to managing these stressed habitats. Yet, 
      quantifying and monitoring biodiversity is often challenging, especially in ocean 
      habitats. Given that many animals make sounds, these cues travel efficiently under 
      water, and emerging technologies are increasingly cost-effective, passive acoustics 
      (a long-standing ocean observation method) is now a potential means of quantifying 
      and monitoring marine biodiversity. Properly applying acoustics for biodiversity 
      assessments is vital. Our goal here is to provide a timely consideration of emerging 
      methods using passive acoustics to measure marine biodiversity. We provide a summary 
      of the brief history of using passive acoustics to assess marine biodiversity and 
      community structure, a critical assessment of the challenges faced, and outline 
      recommended practices and considerations for acoustic biodiversity measurements. We 
      focused on temperate and tropical seas, where much of the acoustic biodiversity work 
      has been conducted. Overall, we suggest a cautious approach to applying current 
      acoustic indices to assess marine biodiversity. Key needs are preliminary data and 
      sampling sufficiently to capture the patterns and variability of a habitat. Yet with 
      new analytical tools including source separation and supervised machine learning, 
      there is substantial promise in marine acoustic diversity assessment methods.

AB  - Traditional monitoring technologies fail to provide accurate or early indications of 
      hypovolemia-mediated extremis because physiological systems (as measured by vital 
      signs) effectively compensate until circulatory failure occurs. Hypovolemia is the 
      most life-threatening physiological condition associated with circulatory shock in 
      hemorrhage or sepsis, and it impairs one's ability to sustain physical exertion 
      during heat stress. This review focuses on the physiology underlying the development 
      of a novel noninvasive wearable technology that allows for real-time evaluation of 
      the cardiovascular system's ability to compensate to hypovolemia, or its 
      compensatory reserve, which provides an individualized estimate of impending 
      circulatory collapse. Compensatory reserve is assessed by real-time changes (sampled 
      millions of times per second) in specific features (hundreds of features) of 
      arterial waveform analog signals that can be obtained from photoplethysmography 
      using machine learning and feature extraction techniques. Extensive experimental 
      evidence employing acute reductions in central blood volume (using lower-body 
      negative pressure, blood withdrawal, heat stress, dehydration) demonstrate that 
      compensatory reserve provides the best indicator for early and accurate assessment 
      for compromises in blood pressure, tissue perfusion, and oxygenation in resting 
      human subjects. Engineering challenges exist for the development of a ruggedized 
      wearable system that can measure signals from multiple sites, improve 
      signal-to-noise ratios, be customized for use in austere conditions (e.g., 
      battlefield, patient transport), and be worn during strenuous physical activity.

TI  - Sparse Deconvolution of Electrodermal Activity via Continuous-Time System 
      Identification.
PG  - 2585-2595
LID - 10.1109/TBME.2019.2892352 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Electrodermal activity (EDA) indicates different eccrine sweat gland 
      activity caused by the stimulation of the autonomic nervous system. Recovering the 
      number, timings, and amplitudes of underlying neural stimuli and physiological 
      system parameters from the EDA is a challenging problem. One of the challenges with 
      the existing methods is the non-convexity of the optimization formulations for 
      estimating the parameters given the stimuli. METHODS: We solve this parameter 
      estimation problem using the following continuous-time system identification 
      framework: 1) we specifically use the Hartley modulating function (HMF) for 
      parameter estimation so that the optimization formulation for estimating the 
      parameters given the stimuli is convex; and 2) we use Kaiser windows with different 
      shape parameters to put more emphasis on the significant spectral components so that 
      there is a balance between filtering out the noise and capturing the data. We apply 
      this algorithm to skin conductance (SC) data, a measure of EDA, collected during 
      cognitive stress experiments. RESULTS: Under a sparsity constraint, in the HMF 
      domain, we successfully deconvolve the SC signal. We obtain number, timings, and 
      amplitudes of the underlying neural stimuli along with the system parameters with 
      R(2) above 0.915. Moreover, using simulated data, we illustrate that our approach 
      outperforms the existing EDA data analysis methods, in recovering underlying 
      stimuli. CONCLUSION: We develop a novel approach for deconvolution of SC by 
      employing the HMF method and capturing the significant spectral components of SC 
      data. SIGNIFICANCE: Recovering the underlying neural stimuli more accurately using 
      this approach will potentially improve tracking emotional states in affective 
      computing.

AB  - On-animal sensor systems provide an opportunity to monitor ewes during parturition, 
      potentially reducing ewe and lamb mortality risk. This study investigated the 
      capacity of machine learning (ML) behaviour classification to monitor changes in 
      sheep behaviour around the time of lambing using ear-borne accelerometers. 
      Accelerometers were attached to 27 ewes grazing a 4.4 ha paddock. Data were then 
      classified based on three different ethograms: (i) detection of grazing, lying, 
      standing, walking; (ii) detection of active behaviour; and (iii) detection of body 
      posture. Proportion of time devoted to performing each behaviour and activity was 
      then calculated at a daily and hourly scale. Frequency of posture change was also 
      calculated on an hourly scale. Assessment of each metric using a linear 
      mixed-effects model was conducted for the 7 days (day scale) or 12 h (hour scale) 
      before and after lambing. For all physical movements, regardless of the ethogram, 
      there was a change in the days surrounding lambing. This involved either a decrease 
      (grazing, lying, active behaviour) or peak (standing, walking) on the day of 
      parturition, with most values returning to either pre-partum or near-pre-partum 
      levels (all P < 0.001). Hourly changes also occurred for all behaviours (all P < 
      0.001), the most marked being increased walking behaviour and frequency of posture 
      change. These findings indicate ewes were more restless around the time of 
      parturition. Further application of this research should focus on development of 
      algorithms that can be used to identify onset of lambing and/or time of parturition 
      in pasture-based ewes.

AB  - Background: Little is known about the effects of targeting memories of adverse 
      (childhood) events in people with a personality disorder (PD). Objective: 
      Determining the effectiveness of brief EMDR therapy in individuals with PD. Method: 
      In a randomized-controlled trial, 97 outpatients with a PD as main diagnosis were 
      allocated to either five (90 minutes) sessions of EMDR therapy (n = 51) or a waiting 
      list (WL) control condition (n = 46) followed by 3 months of treatment as usual for 
      their PD. Individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were excluded. 
      Measurements were performed on psychological symptoms, psychological distress, and 
      personality dysfunctioning. Outcomes were compared at baseline, post-treatment, and 
      at 3-month follow up. Data were analysed as intent-to-treat with linear mixed 
      models. Results: EMDR therapy yielded significant improvements with medium to large 
      effect sizes for the primary outcomes after treatment, i.e. psychological symptoms 
      (EMDR: d =.42; control group: d =.07), psychological distress (EMDR: d =.69; control 
      group: d =.29), and personality functioning (EMDR: d =.41; control group: d = -.10) 
      within groups. At 3-month follow-up, after 3 months of TAU, improvements were 
      maintained. Significant differences were found between both groups regarding all 
      outcome measures in favour of the EMDR group at post-treatment (ds between -.62 and 
      -.65), and at follow-up, after 3 months of TAU (ds between -.45 and -.53). 
      Conclusions: The results suggest that EMDR therapy can be beneficial in the 
      treatment of patients with PDs. More rigorous outcome research examining long-term 
      effects and using a longer treatment track is warranted.

AB  - Neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) greatly expand the use of technology. There is 
      a need to accurately diagnose discomfort, pain, and complications, such as sepsis, 
      mainly before they occur. While specific treatments are possible, they are often 
      time-consuming, invasive, or painful, with detrimental effects for the development 
      of the infant. In the last 40 years, heart rate variability (HRV) has emerged as a 
      non-invasive measurement to monitor newborns and infants, but it still is underused. 
      Hence, the present paper aims to review the utility of HRV in neonatology and the 
      instruments available to assess it, showing how HRV could be an innovative tool in 
      the years to come. When continuously monitored, HRV could help assess the baby's 
      overall wellbeing and neurological development to detect stress-/pain-related 
      behaviors or pathological conditions, such as respiratory distress syndrome and 
      hyperbilirubinemia, to address when to perform procedures to reduce the baby's 
      stress/pain and interventions, such as therapeutic hypothermia, and to avoid severe 
      complications, such as sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis, thus reducing 
      mortality. Based on literature and previous experiences, the first step to 
      efficiently introduce HRV in the NICUs could consist in a monitoring system that 
      uses photoplethysmography, which is low-cost and non-invasive, and displays one or a 
      few metrics with good clinical utility. However, to fully harness HRV clinical 
      potential and to greatly improve neonatal care, the monitoring systems will have to 
      rely on modern bioinformatics (machine learning and artificial intelligence 
      algorithms), which could easily integrate infant's HRV metrics, vital signs, and 
      especially past history, thus elaborating models capable to efficiently monitor and 
      predict the infant's clinical conditions. For this reason, hospitals and 
      institutions will have to establish tight collaborations between the obstetric, 
      neonatal, and pediatric departments: this way, healthcare would truly improve in 
      every stage of the perinatal period (from conception to the first years of life), 
      since information about patients' health would flow freely among different 
      professionals, and high-quality research could be performed integrating the data 
      recorded in those departments.

TI  - Qualitative study of cardiologists' perceptions of factors influencing clinical 
      practice decisions.
PG  - 749-754

AB  - BACKGROUND: Healthcare costs are increasing in the USA and Canada and a substantial 
      portion of health spending is devoted to services that do not improve health 
      outcomes. Efforts to reduce waste by adopting evidence-based clinical practice 
      guideline recommendations have had limited success. We sought insight into improving 
      health system efficiency through understanding cardiologists' perceptions of factors 
      that influence clinical decision-making. METHODS: In this descriptive qualitative 
      study, we conducted in-depth interviews with 18 American and 3 Canadian 
      cardiologists. We used conventional content analysis including inductive and 
      deductive approaches for data analysis and mapped findings to the ecological systems 
      framework. RESULTS: Physicians reported that major determinants of practice included 
      interpersonal interactions with peers, patients and administrators; financial 
      incentives and system factors. Patients' insurance status represented an important 
      consideration for some cardiologists. Other major influences included time 
      constraints, fear of litigation (less prominent in Canada), a sense that their 
      obligation was never to miss any underlying pathology, and patient demands. The need 
      to bring income into their health system influenced American cardiologists' 
      practice; personal income implications influenced Canadian cardiologists' practice. 
      Cardiologists reported that knowledge limitations and logistical challenges limit 
      their ability to assist patients with cost considerations. All these considerations 
      were more influential than guidelines; some cardiologists expressed a high level of 
      scepticism regarding guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical decision-making by 
      cardiologists is shaped by individual, interpersonal, organisational, environmental, 
      financial and sociopolitical influences and only to a limited extent by guideline

TI  - The True Colours Remote Symptom Monitoring System: A Decade of Evolution.
PG  - e15188
LID - 10.2196/15188 [doi]
LID - e15188
AB  - The True Colours remote mood monitoring system was developed over a decade ago by 
      researchers, psychiatrists, and software engineers at the University of Oxford to 
      allow patients to report on a range of symptoms via text messages, Web interfaces, 
      or mobile phone apps. The system has evolved to encompass a wide range of measures, 
      including psychiatric symptoms, quality of life, and medication. Patients are 
      prompted to provide data according to an agreed personal schedule: weekly, daily, or 
      at specific times during the day. The system has been applied across a number of 
      different populations, for the reporting of mood, anxiety, substance use, eating and 
      personality disorders, psychosis, self-harm, and inflammatory bowel disease, and it 
      has shown good compliance. Over the past decade, there have been over 36,000 
      registered True Colours patients and participants in the United Kingdom, with more 
      than 20 deployments of the system supporting clinical service and research delivery. 
      The system has been adopted for routine clinical care in mental health services, 
      supporting more than 3000 adult patients in secondary care, and 27,263 adolescent 
      patients are currently registered within Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire. The system 
      has also proven to be an invaluable scientific resource as a platform for research 
      into mood instability and as an electronic outcome measure in randomized controlled 
      trials. This paper aimed to report on the existing applications of the system, 
      setting out lessons learned, and to discuss the implications for tailored symptom 
      monitoring, as well as the barriers to implementation at a larger scale.

TI  - Peripheral mitochondrial function correlates with clinical severity in idiopathic 
      Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 1192-1202
LID - 10.1002/mds.27723 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease is an intractable disorder with heterogeneous 
      clinical presentation that may reflect different underlying pathogenic mechanisms. 
      Surrogate indicators of pathogenic processes correlating with clinical measures may 
      assist in better patient stratification. Mitochondrial function, which is impaired 
      in and central to PD pathogenesis, may represent one such surrogate indicator. 
      METHODS: Mitochondrial function was assessed by respirometry experiment in 
      fibroblasts derived from idiopathic patients (n = 47) in normal conditions and in 
      experimental settings that do not permit glycolysis and therefore force energy 
      production through mitochondrial function. Respiratory parameters and clinical 
      measures were correlated with bivariate analysis. Machine-learning-based 
      classification and regression trees were used to classify patients on the basis of 
      biochemical and clinical measures. The effects of mitochondrial respiration on 
      α-synuclein stress were assessed monitoring the protein phosphorylation in 
      permitting versus restrictive glycolysis conditions. RESULTS: Bioenergetic 
      properties in peripheral fibroblasts correlate with clinical measures in idiopathic 
      patients, and the correlation is stronger with predominantly nondopaminergic signs. 
      Bioenergetic analysis under metabolic stress, in which energy is produced solely by 
      mitochondria, shows that patients' fibroblasts can augment respiration, therefore 
      indicating that mitochondrial defects are reversible. Forcing energy production 
      through mitochondria, however, favors α-synuclein stress in different cellular 
      experimental systems. Machine-learning-based classification identified different 
      groups of patients in which increasing disease severity parallels higher 
      mitochondrial respiration. CONCLUSION: The suppression of mitochondrial activity in 
      PD may be an adaptive strategy to cope with concomitant pathogenic factors. 
      Moreover, mitochondrial measures in fibroblasts are potential peripheral biomarkers 
      to follow disease progression. © 2019 The Authors. Movement Disorders published by

TI  - Effect of Training and Match Loads on Hamstring Passive Stiffness in Professional 
      Soccer Players.
PG  - 488-497
AB  - OBJECTIVE: the purpose of this study was to identify differences in hamstring 
      passive stiffness between the pre-season and in-season periods. METHODS: Hamstring 
      strength and passive stiffness were measured in professional male soccer players 
      before and after the pre-season (4 weeks), and after the in-season (6 weeks) periods 
      using an isokinetic dynamometer. Muscle passive stiffness was determined from the 
      slope of the passive torque-angle relationship. External loads (acceleration and 
      jumps) were monitored by GPS and internal loads by questionnaire. RESULTS: Hamstring 
      passive stiffness increased after 10 weeks of training and matches, without changes 
      in passive peak torque and range of motion. The hamstring passive stiffness 
      modifications were associated with the volume and intensity of accelerations and 
      jumps. The individual data analysis also provided some support for the suppression 
      of the biomechanical adaptation in the subjects with relatively large external load. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Regular training and match workouts increase hamstring passive 
      stiffness in professional soccer players but the adaptation of muscle-tendon unit 
      passive elements might not occur if players experience excessive mechanical stress.

AB  - Future healthcare systems will rely heavily on clinical decision support systems 
      (CDSS) to improve the decision-making processes of clinicians. To explore the design 
      of future CDSS, we developed a research-focused CDSS for the management of patients 
      in the intensive care unit that leverages Internet of Things (IoT) devices capable 
      of collecting streaming physiologic data from ventilators and other medical devices. 
      We then created machine learning (ML) models that could analyze the collected 
      physiologic data to determine if the ventilator was delivering potentially harmful 
      therapy and if a deadly respiratory condition, acute respiratory distress syndrome 
      (ARDS), was present. We also present work to aggregate these models into a mobile 
      application that can provide responsive, real-time alerts of changes in ventilation 
      to providers. As illustrated in the recent COVID-19 pandemic, being able to 
      accurately predict ARDS in newly infected patients can assist in prioritizing care. 
      We show that CDSS may be used to analyze physiologic data for clinical event 
      recognition and automated diagnosis, and we also highlight future research avenues 
      for hospital CDSS.

TI  - [Analysis of communication in social networks of the influenza vaccine campaign in 
      Spain].
LID - e202003008 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: After arising of anti-vaccine groups and their dissemination, it is 
      necessary to carry out communication campaigns on the benefits of vaccination aimed 
      at citizens, and social networks are a good way to reach a large population. The 
      objective of this article is to determine the communication on Twitter social 
      network during the influenza vaccine campaign in 2018 in Spain. METHODS: Big data 
      methods were used to collect all tweets about the influenza vaccine during October 
      23 to December 15. They were determined by cluster analysis, eigenvector and 
      pagerank calculations to determinate who were the most important influencers during 
      the campaign. RESULTS: A total of 9,147 tweets were collected, of which 71.94% were 
      retweets (RT). Ten groups generated 69.92% of the message traffic on vaccines. The 
      main emotion expressed in the messages about vaccines is the fear of consequences if 
      people do not get vaccinated. CONCLUSIONS: It was determined that the information on 
      the campaign is favorable to vaccination but is mainly directed by (supposedly) 
      doctors, nurses or anonymous patients who tweet and are followed by many users. The 
      official and institutional campaigns, some of which are re-disseminated in a 
      possibly organized way, are very neglected in the monitoring of society in the 
      networks.

TI  - Electrical impedance segmentography: A promising tool for respiratory monitoring?
PG  - 489-494
LID - 10.3233/NPM-190347 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-invasive, radiation free bedside monitoring methods have gained 
      increased popularity in the respiratory field. The aim of our study was to report 
      the experience with electrical impedance segmentography (EIS), a rather new 
      technique, which allows continuous visual and quantitative monitoring of regional 
      lung ventilation. METHODS: Prospective, pilot trial in spontaneously breathing, 
      healthy, non-sedated term neonates between 24 and 72 hours post-delivery using a 
      commercially available EIS-device. Systematic review of the literature. RESULTS: A 
      total of 12 neonates were eligible for complete data analysis in our study. EIS was 
      found to be a safe and easy to perform method. The median duration of the study time 
      was 25 minutes (16-40). Individual total and regional impedance values, given in 
      arbitrary units and it's percentage of distribution in the upper and lower right and 
      left lung segments (UR, UL, LR, LL), were variable (median total impedance 207 
      arbitrary units (AU), UR% 17, LR 27%,UL 28%, LL 23%). A number of influencing 
      factors such as body movements, sucking, jawing, and electrode issues have to be 
      considered for correct data interpretation. The literature search revealed two small 
      experimental studies in neonatal piglets and two human studies (one study in 
      preschool children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia and one case report in a neonate 
      with respiratory distress). CONCLUSIONS: EIS is an innovative technique and a 
      potentially useful tool in studying regional lung ventilation in research and 
      clinical care.

AB  - In-person traditional approaches to mental health care services are facing 
      difficulties amidst the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) crisis. The recent 
      implementation of social distancing has redirected attention to nontraditional 
      mental health care delivery to overcome hindrances to essential services. Telehealth 
      has been established for several decades but has only been able to play a small role 
      in health service delivery. Mobile and teledigital health solutions for mental 
      health are well poised to respond to the upsurge in COVID-19 cases. Screening and 
      tracking with real-time automation and machine learning are useful for both 
      assisting psychological first-aid resources and targeting interventions. However, 
      rigorous evaluation of these new opportunities is needed in terms of quality of 
      interventions, effectiveness, and confidentiality. Service delivery could be 
      broadened to include trained, unlicensed professionals, who may help health care 
      services in delivering evidence-based strategies. Digital mental health services 
      emerged during the pandemic as complementary ways of assisting community members 
      with stress and transitioning to new ways of living and working. As part of a hybrid 
      model of care, technologies (mobile and online platforms) require consolidated and 
      consistent guidelines as well as consensus, expert, and position statements on the 
      screening and tracking (with real-time automation and machine learning) of mental 
      health in general populations as well as considerations and initiatives for 
      underserved and vulnerable subpopulations.

AB  - CONTEXT: Early detection of cardiovascular disease could make a difference in terms 
      of treatment success. For that reason, it is important to test the reliability of 
      tools used to deliver diagnoses and to measure the impact of external factors such 
      as stressful situations on alterations in the data collected. Students are an 
      interesting cohort for investigating the effects of stressful situations, as they 
      have a variable number of stress-causing situations in their daily activity over a 
      short period of time. BASIC PROCEDURE: This investigation used 50 students, each of 
      whom underwent two 21 -h tests involving the measurement of heart rate in beats per 
      minute while they were carrying out their normal daily activities with their own 
      tools. In this case study, we measured the impact of stressful situations with a 
      tool for the self-diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases, using data from students on 
      holiday and during their final exams. We asked the students to select two days on 
      which to use the device and perform the test. The requirements for the days were 
      given to them as follows: for the first test, the students were required to select a 
      day off when their main activity was rest; for the second test, the students were 
      required to select a day in their final exams week that they expected to be the 
      hardest day with the most stressful situations. This paper describes a case study in 
      which we measured the impact of stressful situations with the students' own tools 
      for the self-diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases, using data from students on 
      holiday and during their final exams week. These two datasets, as well as the 
      results of the diagnosis, were compared. MAIN FINDINGS: The analysis of the data 
      showed that if the students were healthy, some cardiovascular conditions could 
      change, and some tendencies could be found in the data, unrelated to stress. The 
      addition of stressful situations does not have a direct impact on the diagnosis. 
      Thus, we can assume that analysing the data with this methodology and technology 
      will give us an accurate result independent of a person's activities during the 
      test. CONCLUSIONS: In this sense, and taking into account that the diagnosis was the 
      same in both cases for all the students, we can say that stressful situations don't 
      modify cardiac dynamics, and the diagnosis is useful in all situations. For that 
      reason, the tool is reliable enough to estimate the cardiovascular health of a 
      patient while he or she performs various daily activities by taking advantage of 
      smartphones, commercial heart rate sensors, and IoT platforms.

AB  - PREMISE: When plants are exposed to stress conditions, irreversible damage can 
      occur, negatively impacting yields. It is therefore important to detect stress 
      symptoms in plants, such as the accumulation of anthocyanin, as early as possible. 
      METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-two regression models in five color spaces were trained 
      to develop a prediction model for plant anthocyanin levels from digital color 
      imaging data. Of these, a quantile random forest regression model trained with 
      standard red, green, blue (sRGB) color space data most accurately predicted the 
      actual anthocyanin levels. This model was then used to noninvasively monitor the 
      spatial and temporal accumulation of anthocyanin in Arabidopsis thaliana leaves. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The digital imaging-based nature of this protocol makes it a low-cost 
      and noninvasive method for the detection of plant stress. Applying a similar 
      protocol to more economically viable crops could lead to the development of 
      large-scale, cost-effective systems for monitoring plant health.

      Programming Contest Case Study.
LID - 10.3390/s19081849 [doi]
LID - 1849
AB  - The negative effects of mental stress on human health has been known for decades. 
      High-level stress must be detected at early stages to prevent these negative 
      effects. After the emergence of wearable devices that could be part of our lives, 
      researchers have started detecting extreme stress of individuals with them during 
      daily routines. Initial experiments were performed in laboratory environments and 
      recently a number of works took a step outside the laboratory environment to the 
      real-life. We developed an automatic stress detection system using physiological 
      signals obtained from unobtrusive smart wearable devices which can be carried during 
      the daily life routines of individuals. This system has modality-specific artifact 
      removal and feature extraction methods for real-life conditions. We further tested 
      our system in a real-life setting with collected physiological data from 21 
      participants of an algorithmic programming contest for nine days. This event had 
      lectures, contests as well as free time. By using heart activity, skin conductance 
      and accelerometer signals, we successfully discriminated contest stress, relatively 
      higher cognitive load (lecture) and relaxed time activities by using different 
      machine learning methods.

AB  - Wearable and portable digital devices can support self-monitoring for patients with 
      chronic medical conditions, individuals seeking to reduce stress, and people seeking 
      to modify health-related behaviors such as substance use or overeating. The 
      resulting data may be used directly by a consumer, or shared with a clinician for 
      treatment, a caregiver for assistance, or a health coach for support. The data can 
      also be used by researchers to develop and evaluate just-in-time interventions that 
      leverage mobile technology to help individuals manage their symptoms and behavior in 
      real time and as needed. Such wearable systems have huge potential for promoting 
      delivery of anywhere-anytime health care, improving public health, and enhancing the 
      quality of life for many people. The Center for Technology and Behavioral Health at 
      Dartmouth College, a P30 "Center of Excellence" supported by the National Institute 
      on Drug Abuse at the National Institutes of Health, conducted a workshop in February 
      2017 on innovations in emerging technology, user-centered design, and data analytics 
      for behavioral health, with presentations by a diverse range of experts in the 
      field. The workshop focused on wearable and mobile technologies being used in 
      clinical and research contexts, with an emphasis on applications in mental health, 
      addiction, and health behavior change. In this paper, we summarize the workshop 
      panels on mobile sensing, user experience design, statistics and machine learning, 
      and privacy and security, and conclude with suggested research directions for this 
      important and emerging field of applying digital approaches to behavioral health. 
      Workshop insights yielded four key directions for future research: (1) a need for 
      behavioral health researchers to work iteratively with experts in emerging 
      technology and data analytics, (2) a need for research into optimal user-interface 
      design for behavioral health technologies, (3) a need for privacy-oriented design 
      from the beginning of a novel technology, and (4) the need to develop new analytical 
      methods that can scale to thousands of individuals and billions of data points.

TI  - Desogestrel and severe psychiatric disorders, a retrospective analysis of Federal 
      Adverse Event Reporting System and Eudravigilance.
LID - 10.2174/1574886315666201005101753 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several studies have been published which stated that there is some 
      connection between severe psychiatric disorders and contraceptive drug 
      "desogestrel". However, nothing in the summary of product characteristics (SmPC) or 
      patient information leaflets of desogestrel about anxiety, more severe anxiety 
      leading to panic attacks, or about risks of severe depression leading to suicidal 
      thoughts or suicide attempts. OBJECTIVE: To examine the safety and risk association 
      between hormonal contraceptive desogestrel among women with psychiatric disorders 
      using adverse drug reaction database of FDA Adverse Events Reporting System (FAERS) 
      and Eudravigilance (EV). METHODS: Individual case safety reports (ICSRs) of only 
      female patients from Jan 1999 to Nov 2019 and Jan 2004 to Nov 2019 were downloaded 
      from FAERS and EV database respectively. Reports of drug desogestrel, dienogest, 
      norgestimate, cyproterone acetate and drospirenone were downloaded. 
      Disproportionality method of data mining was used to calculate the risk association. 
      RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The lower limit of 95 % CI of PRR is -0.28 and 2.02, PRR was 
      1.08 and 9.18, ROR is 1.09 (95%CI: 0.74, 1.59) and 9.26 (95% CI: 7.21, 11.89), Chi 
      square value is 1.21 and 433.68, and IC-2SD is -0.27 and 2.60 respectively for data 
      obtained from FAERS and EV. CONCLUSION: From this study, we conclude that there is 
      no new emerging signal for the drug-event pair studied. Further study and continuous 
      monitoring is required in future to know more about this drug-event pair 
      association, as severe psychiatric disorders is not yet mentioned or included in 
      SmPC and patient leaflet of desogestrel.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess longitudinally the change in quality of life in people living 
      with HIV initiating antiretroviral therapy in three public reference services 
      specialized in HIV care in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. METHODS: Prospective cohort study 
      among people living with HIV, aged 18 years or older, and initiating antiretroviral 
      therapy. We obtained sociodemographic, behavioral, clinical data related to 
      pharmacological treatment and to the service by face-to-face interviews, and 
      supplemented these data with information from clinical records and Information 
      Systems of the Brazilian HIV/AIDS Program. We measured the quality of life using the 
      WHOQOL-HIV bref instrument, with a minimum interval of six months between the 
      baseline and the follow-up interviews. We used paired t-test to assess the mean 
      change in quality of life between the two interviewsand evaluated factors associated 
      with this outcome using multiple linear regression. RESULTS: The overall quality of 
      life, as well as the physical, psychological, level of independence, environment and 
      spiritual quality of life domains were statistically higher in people living with 
      HIV using antiretroviral therapy at the end of the follow-up. Factors independently 
      associated with the increase in quality of life were having religious belief and 
      living with other people. Having signs or symptoms of anxiety and depression and the 
      number of adverse drug reactions reported were predictors associated with worsening 
      quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: These results show an improvement in the quality of 
      life over time in people living with HIV on antiretroviral therapy. They also 
      highlight the need to monitor and provide health care support, especially for 
      individuals with signs and symptoms of anxiety and depression and that report 
      adverse reactions to medicines at the beginning of treatment.

AB  - The plasma membrane is a sophisticated, organized, and highly heterogeneous 
      structure that compartmentalizes cellular processes. To decipher the biological 
      processes involving membrane proteins, it is necessary to analyze their 
      spatiotemporal dynamics. However, it is difficult to directly assess the dynamics 
      and interactions of biomolecules in living cells using traditional biochemical 
      methods. Single-particle tracking (SPT) methods for imaging and tracking single 
      particles conjugated with fluorescent probes offer an ideal approach to acquire 
      valuable and complementary information about dynamic intracellular processes. SPT 
      can be used to quantitatively monitor the diverse motions of individual particles in 
      living cells. SPT also provides super-spatiotemporal resolution that allows 
      early-stage or rapid response information to be obtained for a better understanding 
      of molecular basis of associated signal transduction processes. More importantly, 
      SPT can be used to detect the motion paths of individual biomolecules in vivo and in 
      situ, thus unveiling the dynamic behavior of the biomolecules that support 
      developmental processes in living cells. In this review, we give an overview of SPT 
      methods, from image acquisition to the detection of single particles, as well as 
      tracking and data analysis. We also discuss recent applications of SPT methods in 
      the field of plant biology to reveal the complex biological functions of membrane 
      proteins.

TI  - Interaction and Engagement with an Anxiety Management App: Analysis Using 
      Large-Scale Behavioral Data.
PG  - e58
LID - 10.2196/mental.9235 [doi]
LID - e58
AB  - BACKGROUND: SAM (Self-help for Anxiety Management) is a mobile phone app that 
      provides self-help for anxiety management. Launched in 2013, the app has achieved 
      over one million downloads on the iOS and Android platform app stores. Key features 
      of the app are anxiety monitoring, self-help techniques, and social support via a 
      mobile forum ("the Social Cloud"). This paper presents unique insights into eMental 
      health app usage patterns and explores user behaviors and usage of self-help 
      techniques. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to investigate behavioral 
      engagement and to establish discernible usage patterns of the app linked to the 
      features of anxiety monitoring, ratings of self-help techniques, and social 
      participation. METHODS: We use data mining techniques on aggregate data obtained 
      from 105,380 registered users of the app's cloud services. RESULTS: Engagement 
      generally conformed to common mobile participation patterns with an inverted pyramid 
      or "funnel" of engagement of increasing intensity. We further identified 4 distinct 
      groups of behavioral engagement differentiated by levels of activity in anxiety 
      monitoring and social feature usage. Anxiety levels among all monitoring users were 
      markedly reduced in the first few days of usage with some bounce back effect 
      thereafter. A small group of users demonstrated long-term anxiety reduction (using a 
      robust measure), typically monitored for 12-110 days, with 10-30 discrete updates 
      and showed low levels of social participation. CONCLUSIONS: The data supported our 
      expectation of different usage patterns, given flexible user journeys, and varying 
      commitment in an unstructured mobile phone usage setting. We nevertheless show an 
      aggregate trend of reduction in self-reported anxiety across all minimally-engaged 
      users, while noting that due to the anonymized dataset, we did not have information 
      on users also enrolled in therapy or other intervention while using the app. We find 
      several commonalities between these app-based behavioral patterns and traditional 
      therapy engagement.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alkaptonuria (AKU) is an ultra-rare autosomal recessive disease caused 
      by a mutation in the homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase (HGD) gene. One of the main 
      obstacles in studying AKU, and other ultra-rare diseases, is the lack of a 
      standardized methodology to assess disease severity or response to treatment. 
      Quality of Life scores (QoL) are a reliable way to monitor patients' clinical 
      condition and health status. QoL scores allow to monitor the evolution of diseases 
      and assess the suitability of treatments by taking into account patients' symptoms, 
      general health status and care satisfaction. However, more comprehensive tools to 
      study a complex and multi-systemic disease like AKU are needed. In this study, a 
      Machine Learning (ML) approach was implemented with the aim to perform a prediction 
      of QoL scores based on clinical data deposited in the ApreciseKUre, an AKU- 
      dedicated database. METHOD: Data derived from 129 AKU patients have been firstly 
      examined through a preliminary statistical analysis (Pearson correlation 
      coefficient) to measure the linear correlation between 11 QoL scores. The variable 
      importance in QoL scores prediction of 110 ApreciseKUre biomarkers has been then 
      calculated using XGBoost, with K-nearest neighbours algorithm (k-NN) approach. Due 
      to the limited number of data available, this model has been validated using 
      surrogate data analysis. RESULTS: We identified a direct correlation of 6 (age, 
      Serum Amyloid A, Chitotriosidase, Advanced Oxidation Protein Products, S-thiolated 
      proteins and Body Mass Index) out of 110 biomarkers with the QoL health status, in 
      particular with the KOOS (Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) symptoms 
      (Relative Absolute Error (RAE) 0.25). The error distribution of surrogate-model (RAE 
      0.38) was unequivocally higher than the true-model one (RAE of 0.25), confirming the 
      consistency of our dataset. Our data showed that inflammation, oxidative stress, 
      amyloidosis and lifestyle of patients correlates with the QoL scores for physical 
      status, while no correlation between the biomarkers and patients' mental health was 
      present (RAE 1.1). CONCLUSIONS: This proof of principle study for rare diseases 
      confirms the importance of database, allowing data management and analysis, which 
      can be used to predict more effective treatments.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pulmonary embolism (PE) is the third most common cause of cardiovascular 
      death. However, comprehensive knowledge on the lived experience of patients with PE 
      is lacking so far. The objective of this study was to fill this gap using a 
      qualitative research approach. METHODS: A qualitative study using focus group 
      methodology was conducted. Sampling of patients followed the maximum variation 
      strategy. Sample size was determined by saturation. The patients were presented 
      eight questions, which asked for their experiences in terms of prodromal and acute 
      symptoms, changes of physical and mental well-being, daily life and social life, and 
      experiences with PE medication and treatment. The focus group discussions were 
      digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim. The constant comparative method was 
      used for data analysis. RESULTS: Five focus groups with n = 18 participants (50% 
      female, median age 56 years) in total were performed. Major identified themes were: 
      (1) progressing dyspnea and pain as major prodromal and acute symptoms, (2) 
      persisting dyspnea and loss of physical fitness, (3) depression, fears and threat 
      monitoring, (4) exhaustion which improves over time, (5) social contacts ranging 
      between ignorance and overprotection, (6) anticoagulants as lifesavers and threat, 
      (7) quick versus delayed diagnosis, (8) left alone by health care providers, and (9) 
      unsupportive health care system. CONCLUSION: PE may be associated with considerable 
      mental health problems and the existing health care system is experienced as not 
      supportive by a number of patients. Further results from larger, quantitative 
      studies are needed to estimate the extent of the identified problems.

LID - 525
AB  - About 30% of diabetes patients suffer from varying degrees of depression. Diabetes 
      itself is associated with abnormal carbohydrate and energy metabolism. Whether 
      chronic stress-induced depression-like behavior impacts the metabolome of blood 
      plasma and urine in diabetes is not clear. This study aimed to investigate the 
      effect of chronic stress on metabolome of plasma and urine in spontaneously diabetic 
      Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats. The GK rats were subjected to 8 weeks' chronic 
      unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) to induce depression-like behavior. Metabolome 
      analysis of blood plasma and urine using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry 
      (LC/MS) was performed. Multivariate data analysis was used to evaluate the data. 
      Behavior and biochemical assay confirmed the successful establishment of 
      CUMS-induced depression-like behavior model in rats. Disturbance of 20 plasma 
      metabolites and 16 urine metabolites were altered in CUMS-induced depression GK rats 
      as compared to control ones. These disturbed metabolites were involved in fatty acid 
      metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism, phenylalanine metabolism, citrate cycle, 
      glycolysis, glutathione metabolism, and nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism. This 
      study suggest that chronic stress-induced depression-like behavior may further 
      disturb diabetes-itself energy metabolome. The plasma and urine lipid metabolites 
      monitoring may be useful for early detection of depression in patients with diabetes 
      mellitus.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study explored the experiences of young adults who participated in 
      biofeedback training and reported a family history of cardiovascular disease. 
      DESIGN: A qualitative descriptive study design was used. METHOD: Private 
      semistructured interviews were conducted on a purposive sample. Young adults (N = 9) 
      were interviewed about their experiences using paced breathing biofeedback training 
      with continuous blood pressure monitoring. Codes were identified across the sample 
      with common themes recorded. FINDINGS: Data analysis yielded four themes: skeptical 
      inquisition, tangible impression, positive health impact, and motivation. Prior to 
      using biofeedback, participants were extremely skeptical of the training. However, 
      all participants found it useful for health maintenance and stress reduction. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Biofeedback therapy may be a promising alternative and holistic 
      approach to managing blood pressure and psychological stress in young adults. This 
      is a complementary approach that nurses can incorporate when caring for the holistic 
      needs of young adults.

TI  - Evaluation of efficiency of puppet show in decreasing fears of school-age children 
      against medical procedures in Zonguldak (Turkey).
PG  - 817-822
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine children's medical fears and to evaluate the effectiveness 
      of puppet show to decrease such fears. METHODS: The quasi-experimental study was 
      conducted from February 1 to May 31, 2016, in Zonguldak, Turkey, and comprised 
      primary school students. Descriptive Information Form and Medical Operations Fear 
      Scale were used to collect data. Those found to be 'very afraid' subsequently 
      underwent a puppet show. The Scale was applied postintervention o track changes. 
      SPSS 18 was used for data analysis. RESULTS: There were 617 children with a mean age 
      of 8.86}0.96 years and studying in second third and fourth grades. Of them, 
      316(51.2%) were boys. The mean score on the fear scale was 43.9}1.03 (range: 
      29-87); 58(9.4%) were terrified of medical procedures. There was a significant 
      difference between the scores of children with respect to the year of education 
      (p=0.001), age (p=0.0001), previous hospitalisations (p=0.0001), previous fears 
      related to hospitalisations (p=0.0021) and fear of being sick (p=0.0001). Two 
      sessions of puppet shows were performed for 44(76%) of the terrified students. There 
      was a significant difference between baseline and post-intervention scores 
      (p=0.0001).. CONCLUSIONS: Age, previous negative experiences of hospitalisations and 
      the fear of being sick were factors that shaped children's medical fears. Puppet 
      show effectively decreased such fears.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It is important to measure the public response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
      Twitter is an important data source for infodemiology studies involving public 
      response monitoring. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to examine 
      COVID-19-related discussions, concerns, and sentiments using tweets posted by 
      Twitter users. METHODS: We analyzed 4 million Twitter messages related to the 
      COVID-19 pandemic using a list of 20 hashtags (eg, "coronavirus," "COVID-19," 
      "quarantine") from March 7 to April 21, 2020. We used a machine learning approach, 
      Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), to identify popular unigrams and bigrams, salient 
      topics and themes, and sentiments in the collected tweets. RESULTS: Popular unigrams 
      included "virus," "lockdown," and "quarantine." Popular bigrams included "COVID-19," 
      "stay home," "corona virus," "social distancing," and "new cases." We identified 13 
      discussion topics and categorized them into 5 different themes: (1) public health 
      measures to slow the spread of COVID-19, (2) social stigma associated with COVID-19, 
      (3) COVID-19 news, cases, and deaths, (4) COVID-19 in the United States, and (5) 
      COVID-19 in the rest of the world. Across all identified topics, the dominant 
      sentiments for the spread of COVID-19 were anticipation that measures can be taken, 
      followed by mixed feelings of trust, anger, and fear related to different topics. 
      The public tweets revealed a significant feeling of fear when people discussed new 
      COVID-19 cases and deaths compared to other topics. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed 
      that Twitter data and machine learning approaches can be leveraged for an 
      infodemiology study, enabling research into evolving public discussions and 
      sentiments during the COVID-19 pandemic. As the situation rapidly evolves, several 
      topics are consistently dominant on Twitter, such as confirmed cases and death 
      rates, preventive measures, health authorities and government policies, COVID-19 
      stigma, and negative psychological reactions (eg, fear). Real-time monitoring and 
      assessment of Twitter discussions and concerns could provide useful data for public 
      health emergency responses and planning. Pandemic-related fear, stigma, and mental 
      health concerns are already evident and may continue to influence public trust when 
      a second wave of COVID-19 occurs or there is a new surge of the current pandemic.

AB  - We present an IoT-based monitoring system for healthcare that allows for long-term 
      measurements of blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and body weight (BW), as well 
      as near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) for measurement of prefrontal cortex (PFC) 
      activity. To verify the applicability of the system, it was set up in a local 
      fitness gym for a preliminary study. A total of 39 subjects, selected from members 
      of the gym, participated in the study. We analyzed the BP, HR, and BW data, 
      collected from the subjects over one half-year. In addition, to assess the degree of 
      mental stress of the subjects, we analysed left-right asymmetry of the PFC activity 
      using the laterality index at rest (LIR) of the NIRS parameter. Results show that 
      the subjects were able to measure their physiological data by themselves when they 
      visited the gym, after being instructed how to perform the measurements. 
      Furthermore, the results also indicate that ordinary people can continuously monitor 
      physiological functions such as brain function in a non-medical facility, such as a 
      fitness gym.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: In 2017, a national recommendation on multidrug-resistant bacterial 
      microorganisms (MDRO) in end-of-life care was published. In order to monitor the 
      implementation in a hospital-based palliative care unit, a dedicated 
      multidisciplinary working group on MDRO was established. It developed a standard 
      operating procedure and a documentation template (checklist). The aim of the present 
      study is to evaluate the implementation status after one year. METHODS: A 
      mixed-methods approach was selected. The status of implementation was identified 
      through a survey among staff members. A retrospective routine data analysis was 
      performed. A focus group discussion with members of the working group focused on 
      previous steps, factors conducive to implementation and on remaining problems. 
      RESULTS: Almost all (18 out of 20) participants (20 out of 29 eligible staff 
      members) knew the national recommendations. Twelve out of 27 recommendations had a 
      high degree of implementation after one year, another 13 recommendations were seen 
      as at least partly integrated into daily routine. For two recommendations the degree 
      of implementation was rated low: (i) "Taking into account any additional time 
      constraint imposed by protection and isolation measures when planning for personnel 
      and bed occupancy", and (ii) "Facilitating the patient's ability to distinguish and 
      recognize team members and family caregivers". Working group members reported 
      improvements since the implementation, whilst reporting some uncertainty prevailing 
      among both staff members and visitors. Inhibitory factors were said to include the 
      complexity of the standard operating procedure, inadequate usage and poor usability 
      of the checklist. Behavioural and cognitive barriers such as anxieties related to 
      transmission and the sense of security caused by the routine use of protective 
      clothing were considered to be strong. Improving the checklist and the standard 
      operating procedure as well as anchoring procedures in daily routine were considered 
      to be the next important steps. DISCUSSION: The implementation of recommendations is 
      an iterative process and requires the ongoing development of appropriate measures 
      for implementation in the respective institution. A multidisciplinary working group 
      with monitoring tasks is an advantage.

AB  - Plan Ceibal is the name coined in Uruguay for the local implementation of the One 
      Laptop Per Child (OLPC) initiative. Plan Ceibal distributes laptops and tablets to 
      students and teachers, and also deploys a nationwide wireless network to provide 
      Internet access to these devices, provides video conference facilities, and develops 
      educational applications. Given the scale of the program, management in general, and 
      specifically device management, is a very challenging task. Device maintenance and 
      replacement is a particularly important process; users trigger such kind of 
      replacement processes and usually imply several days without the device. Early 
      detection of fault conditions in the most stressed hardware parts (e.g., batteries) 
      would permit to prompt defensive replacement, contributing to reduce downtime, and 
      improving the user experience. Seeking for better, preventive and scalable device 
      management, in this paper we present a prototype of a Mobile Device Management (MDM) 
      module for Plan Ceibal, developed over an IoT infrastructure, showing the results of 
      a controlled experiment over a sample of the devices. The prototype is deployed over 
      a public IoT infrastructure to speed up the development process, avoiding, in this 
      phase, the need for local infrastructure and maintenance, while enforcing 
      scalability and security requirements. The presented data analysis was implemented 
      off-line and represents a sample of possible metrics which could be used to 
      implement preventive management in a real deployment.

TI  - Self-monitoring Lifestyle Behavior in Overweight and Obese Pregnant Women: 
      Qualitative Findings.
PG  - 81-89
LID - 10.1097/NUR.0000000000000355 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Excessive maternal gestational weight gain increases pregnancy and 
      infant complications. Self-monitoring has been shown to be an effective strategy in 
      weight management. Literature, however, is limited in describing pregnant women's 
      engagement in self-monitoring. AIM: This qualitative study explored the experiences 
      of overweight and obese pregnant women who self-monitored their eating, walking, and 
      weight as participants in an intervention for excessive gestational weight gain 
      prevention. METHODS: Thirteen overweight and obese pregnant women participated in 
      semistructured interviews. Reflexive iteration data analysis was conducted. 
      FINDINGS: Five themes were identified: making self-monitoring a habit, strategies 
      for self-monitoring, barriers to self-monitoring, benefits of self-monitoring, and 
      drawbacks of self-monitoring. The women viewed self-monitoring as a "habit" that 
      could foster a sense of self-control and mindfulness. Visual or tracing aids were 
      used to maintain the self-monitoring habit. Forgetting, defective tracking aids, 
      complexities of food monitoring, and life events could impede self-monitoring. Being 
      unable to keep up with self-monitoring or to achieve goals created stress. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Self-monitoring is a promising approach to weight management for 
      overweight and obese pregnant women. However, healthcare providers should be aware 
      that, although women may identify several benefits to self-monitoring, for some 
      women, consistently trying to track their behaviors is stressful.

TI  - Entropy analysis of heart rate variability and its application to recognize major 
      depressive disorder: A pilot study.
PG  - 407-424
LID - 10.3233/THC-199037 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The current method to evaluate major depressive disorder (MDD) relies on 
      subjective clinical interviews and self-questionnaires. OBJECTIVE: Autonomic 
      imbalance in MDD patients is characterized using entropy measures of heart rate 
      variability (HRV). A machine learning approach for screening depression based on the 
      entropy is demonstrated. METHODS: The participants experience five experimental 
      phases: baseline (BASE), stress task (MAT), stress task recovery (REC1), relaxation 
      task (RLX), and relaxation task recovery (REC2). The four entropy indices, 
      approximate entropy, sample entropy, fuzzy entropy, and Shannon entropy, are 
      extracted for each phase, and a total of 20 features are used. A support vector 
      machine classifier and recursive feature elimination are employed for 
      classification. RESULTS: The entropy features are lower in the MDD group; however, 
      the disease does not have a significant effect. Experimental tasks significantly 
      affect the features. The entropy did not recover during REC1. The differences in the 
      entropy features between the two groups increased after MAT and showed the largest 
      gap in REC2. We achieved 70% accuracy, 64% sensitivity, and 76% specificity with 
      three optimal features during RLX and REC2. CONCLUSION: Monitoring of HRV complexity 
      changes when a subject experiences autonomic arousal and recovery can potentially 
      facilitate objective depression recognition.

TI  - In Situ Microscopy for Real-time Determination of Single-cell Morphology in 
      Bioprocesses.
LID - 10.3791/57823 [doi]
AB  - In situ monitoring in microbial bioprocesses is mostly restricted to chemical and 
      physical properties of the medium (e.g.,pH value and the dissolved oxygen 
      concentration). Nevertheless, the morphology of cells can be a suitable indicator 
      for optimal conditions, since it changes with dependence on the growth state, 
      product accumulation and cell stress. Furthermore, the single-cell size distribution 
      provides not only information about the cultivation conditions, but also about the 
      population heterogeneity. To gain such information, a photo-optical in situ 
      microscopy device(1) was developed to enable the monitoring of the single-cell size 
      distribution directly in the cell suspension in bioreactors. An automated image 
      analysis is coupled to the microscopy based on a neural network model, which is 
      trained with user-annotated images. Several parameters, which are gained from the 
      captures of the microscope, are correlated to process relevant features of the 
      cells, like their metabolic activity. Until now, the presented in situ microscopy 
      probe series was applied to measure the pellet size in filamentous fungi 
      suspensions. It was used to distinguish the single-cell size in microalgae 
      cultivation and relate it to lipid accumulation. The shape of cellular particles was 
      related to budding in yeast cultures. The microscopy analysis can be generally split 
      into three steps: (i) image acquisition, (ii) particle identification, and (iii) 
      data analysis, respectively. All steps have to be adapted to the organism, and 
      therefore specific annotated information is required in order to achieve reliable 
      results. The ability to monitor changes in cell morphology directly in line or on 
      line (in a by-pass) enables real-time values for monitoring and control, in process 
      development as well as in production scale. If the off line data correlates with the 
      real-time data, the current tedious off line measurements with unknown influences on 
      the cell size become needless.

AB  - The mammalian heart undergoes complex structural and functional remodeling to 
      compensate for stresses such as pressure overload. While studies suggest that, at 
      best, the adult mammalian heart is capable of very limited regeneration arising from 
      the proliferation of existing cardiomyocytes, how myocardial stress affects 
      endogenous cardiac regeneration or repair is unknown. To define the relationship 
      between left ventricular afterload and cardiac repair, we induced left ventricle 
      pressure overload in adult mice by constriction of the ascending aorta (AAC). One 
      week following AAC, we normalized ventricular afterload in a subset of animals 
      through removal of the aortic constriction (de-AAC). Subsequent monitoring of 
      cardiomyocyte cell cycle activity via thymidine analog labeling revealed that an 
      acute increase in ventricular afterload induced cardiomyocyte proliferation. 
      Intriguingly, a release in ventricular overload (de-AAC) further increases 
      cardiomyocyte proliferation. Following both AAC and de-AAC, thymidine 
      analog-positive cardiomyocytes exhibited characteristics of newly generated 
      cardiomyocytes, including single diploid nuclei and reduced cell size as compared to 
      age-matched, sham-operated adult mouse myocytes. Notably, those smaller 
      cardiomyocytes frequently resided alongside one another, consistent with local 
      stimulation of cellular proliferation. Collectively, our data demonstrate that adult 
      cardiomyocyte proliferation can be locally stimulated by an acute increase or 
      decrease of ventricular pressure, and this mode of stimulation can be harnessed to 
      promote cardiac repair.

TI  - Symptom burden in patients with cancer who are experiencing unplanned 
      hospitalization.
PG  - 2924-2933
LID - 10.1002/cncr.32833 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inpatient supportive care programs often target patients with advanced 
      solid tumors. To the authors' knowledge, few studies to date have characterized 
      symptom burden in hospitalized patients with potentially curable cancers. The 
      objective of the current study was to compare symptom burden, palliative care 
      consultation, and readmission rates in hospitalized patients by cancer type and 
      treatment intent. METHODS: The authors conducted a single-center study of 
      hospitalized patients with cancer between 2014 and 2017. They assessed physical 
      symptoms using the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System and psychological distress 
      using the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 and the Primary Care PTSD (Posttraumatic 
      Stress Disorder) Screen. Multivariate linear regression models were used to assess 
      symptom burden, logistic regression was used to assess palliative care use, and 
      competing risk regression was used to compare 90-day readmission risk. RESULTS: A 
      total of 1549 patients were enrolled and surveyed. The majority of patients reported 
      moderate to severe fatigue, poor well-being, and drowsiness with no significant 
      differences noted by cancer type and treatment intent. Compared with other groups, 
      patients with incurable solid cancer reported higher physical symptoms (beta 
      coefficient [B], 4.73; P < .01) and symptoms of depression (B, 0.44; P < .01) and 
      anxiety (B, 0.39; P < .01), but no difference in posttraumatic stress disorder. 
      Among patients in the top quartile symptom burden according to the Edmonton Symptom 
      Assessment System, the palliative care service was consulted in 14.7%, 7.9%, 25.0%, 
      and 49.6%, respectively, of patients with potentially curable hematologic, 
      potentially curable solid, incurable hematologic, and incurable solid cancers 
      (P < .001). Compared with patients with potentially curable solid cancer, patients 
      in each group experienced a higher risk of readmission within 90 days. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Hospitalized patients with cancer experience substantial physical and psychological 
      symptoms. Palliative care rarely is consulted for highly symptomatic patients with 
      potentially curable cancers. Supportive care interventions should target the needs 
      of symptomatic patients regardless of treatment intent.

AB  - Tracking symptoms progression in the early stages of Parkinson's disease (PD) is a 
      laborious endeavor as the disease can be expressed with vastly different phenotypes, 
      forcing clinicians to follow a multi-parametric approach in patient evaluation, 
      looking for not only motor symptomatology but also non-motor complications, 
      including cognitive decline, sleep problems and mood disturbances. Being 
      neurodegenerative in nature, PD is expected to inflict a continuous degradation in 
      patients' condition over time. The rate of symptoms progression, however, is found 
      to be even more chaotic than the vastly different phenotypes that can be expressed 
      in the initial stages of PD. In this work, an analysis of baseline PD 
      characteristics is performed using machine learning techniques, to identify 
      prognostic factors for early rapid progression of PD symptoms. Using open data from 
      the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) study, an extensive set of 
      baseline patient evaluation outcomes is examined to isolate determinants of rapid 
      progression within the first two and four years of PD. The rate of symptoms 
      progression is estimated by tracking the change of the Movement Disorder 
      Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) total score over the 
      corresponding follow-up period. Patients are ranked according to their progression 
      rates and those who expressed the highest rates of MDS-UPDRS total score increase 
      per year of follow-up period are assigned into the rapid progression class, using 5- 
      and 10-quantiles partition. Classification performance against the rapid progression 
      class was evaluated in a per quantile partition analysis scheme and in 
      quantile-independent approach, respectively. The results shown a more accurate 
      patient discrimination with quantile partitioning, however, a much more compact 
      subset of baseline factors is extracted in the latter, making a more suitable for 
      actual interventions in practice. Classification accuracy improved in all cases when 
      using the longer 4-year follow-up period to estimate PD progression, suggesting that 
      a prolonged patient evaluation can provide better outcomes in identifying rapid 
      progression phenotype. Non-motor symptoms are found to be the main determinants of 
      rapid symptoms progression in both follow-up periods, with autonomic dysfunction, 
      mood impairment, anxiety, REM sleep behavior disorders, cognitive decline and memory 
      impairment being alarming signs at baseline evaluation, along with rigidity 
      symptoms, certain laboratory blood test results and genetic mutations.

AB  - Identification and development of salinity tolerant genotypes and varieties are one 
      of the promising ways to improve productivity of salt-affected soils. Alternate 
      methods to achieve this are required as the conventional methods are time-consuming 
      and often difficult to handle large population of genotypes. In this context, 
      hyperspectral remote sensing could be one of the rapid, repeatable and reliable 
      methods. The aim of the present study is to develop non-invasive high-throughput 
      phenotyping techniques for salinity stress monitoring in rice. Spectral signature of 
      leaf samples from 56 salinity stress tolerant and sensitive rice genotypes were 
      collected at maximum tillering and flowering stage in visible and near-infrared 
      (VNIR) domain. The spectral reflectance data and rice leaf potassium, sodium, 
      calcium, magnesium, iron, manganese, zinc and copper concentration were analyzed for 
      optimum index identification and multivariate model development. Novel hyperspectral 
      indices sensitive to leaf nutrient status as affected by salinity stress were 
      identified. The correlation coefficient during calibration and validation of the 
      optimized indices varied between 0.34-0.63 and 0.36-0.66, respectively. To develop 
      multivariate model, solo partial least square regression (PLSR), PLSR- and principal 
      component analysis (PCA)-combined machine learning models were tested. The results 
      revealed that the performance of PLSR-combined models was the best followed by 
      PCA-based model while indices based model was found to be least accurate. The 
      results obtained in the present study showed potential of hyperspectral remote 
      sensing for non-destructive phenotyping of salinity stress.

AB  - This paper reports a study from Cape Town, South Africa, that tested an existing 
      framework of everyday health system resilience (EHSR) in examining how a local 
      health system responded to the chronic stress of large-scale organizational change. 
      Over two years (2017-18), through cycles of action-learning involving local managers 
      and researchers, the authorial team tracked the stress experienced, the response 
      strategies implemented and their consequences. The paper considers how a set of 
      micro-governance interventions and mid-level leadership practices supported 
      responses to stress whilst nurturing organizational resilience capacities. Data 
      collection involved observation, in-depth interviews and analysis of meeting minutes 
      and secondary data. Data analysis included iterative synthesis and validation 
      processes. The paper offers five sets of insights that add to the limited empirical 
      health system resilience literature: 1) resilience is a process not an end-state; 2) 
      resilience strategies are deployed in combination rather than linearly, after each 
      other; 3) three sets of organizational resilience capacities work together to 
      support collective problem-solving and action entailed in EHSR; 4) these capacities 
      can be nurtured by mid-level managers' leadership practices and simple adaptations 
      of routine organizational processes, such as meetings; 5) central level actions must 
      nurture EHSR by enabling the leadership practices and micro-governance processes 
      entailed in everyday decision-making.

TI  - What do we know about exposure of Iranians to cadmium? Findings from a systematic 
      review.
PG  - 1-11

AB  - Cadmium is an important environmental contaminant. High consumption of chemical 
      fertilizers and industrial activities in recent decades has caused people to be 
      worried about exposure to cadmium. There is no policy for environmental and 
      biological monitoring of exposure to cadmium in the general population in Iran. This 
      study was aimed to review cadmium content in consuming foods and biological samples 
      in Iran, systematically. We developed a comprehensive search strategy and used it to 
      search on Web of Science, Scopus, Science Direct, and Scientific Information 
      Database until 28 December 2016. The totals of 285 articles were identified and 
      finally 31 original papers were selected. Cadmium contamination was found in Iranian 
      food groups such as rice, cereal and legumes, canned tuna fish, vegetables, fruit 
      juice, and egg. This study showed that cadmium amount in 75% of the consumed rice 
      samples (domestic and imported) was higher than the maximum limits approved by 
      institute of standards and industrial research of Iran. Lettuce samples in Yazd were 
      recorded the highest concentration of cadmium compared to other studies. In 
      addition, high amount of cadmium was observed in the blood of the general 
      population. Regarding the cadmium contamination in food and blood samples in Iran, 
      policies must be adopted to reduce exposure to cadmium through different matrices as 
      much as possible.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent years, there has been significant developments in surgical 
      robots. Image-based sensing of surgical instruments, without the use of electric 
      sensors, are preferred for easily washable robots. METHODS: We propose a method to 
      estimate the three-dimensional posture of the tip of the forceps tip by using an 
      endoscopic image. A convolutional neural network (CNN) receives the image of the 
      tracked markers attached to the forceps as an input and outputs the posture of the 
      forceps. RESULTS: The posture estimation results showed that the posture estimated 
      from the image followed the electrical sensor. The estimated results of the external 
      force calculated based on the posture also followed the measured values. CONCLUSION: 
      The method which estimates the forceps posture from the image using CNN is 
      effective. The mean absolute error of the estimated external force is smaller than 
      the human detection limit.

TI  - Comparison of Machine Learning Algorithms for Structure State Prediction in 
      Operational Load Monitoring.
LID - 10.3390/s20247087 [doi]
LID - 7087
AB  - The aim of operational load monitoring is to make predictions about the remaining 
      usability time of structures, which is extremely useful in aerospace industry where 
      in-service life of aircraft structural components can be maximized, taking into 
      account safety. In order to make such predictions, strain sensors are mounted to the 
      structure, from which data are acquired during operational time. This allows to 
      determine how many load cycles has the structure withstood so far. Continuous 
      monitoring of the strain distribution of the whole structure can be complicated due 
      to vicissitude nature of the loads. Sensors should be mounted in places where stress 
      and strain accumulations occur, and due to experiencing variable loads, the number 
      of required sensors may be high. In this work, different machine learning and 
      artificial intelligence algorithms are implemented to predict the current safety 
      factor of the structure in its most stressed point, based on relatively low number 
      of strain measurements. Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS), 
      support-vector machines (SVM) and Gaussian processes for machine learning (GPML) are 
      trained with simulation data, and their effectiveness is measured using data 
      obtained from experiments. The proposed methods are compared to the earlier work 
      where artificial neural networks (ANN) were proven to be efficiently used for 
      reduction of the number of sensors in operational load monitoring processes. A 
      numerical comparison of accuracy and computational time (taking into account 
      possible real-time applications) between all considered methods is provided.

AB  - Just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs), typically smartphone apps, learn to 
      deliver therapeutic content when users need it. The challenge is to "push" content 
      at algorithmically chosen moments without making users trigger it with effortful 
      input. We trained a randomForest algorithm to predict heroin craving, cocaine 
      craving, or stress (reported via smartphone app 3x/day) 90 min into the future, 
      using 16 weeks of field data from 189 outpatients being treated for opioid-use 
      disorder. We used only one form of continuous input (along with person-level 
      demographic data), collected passively: an indicator of environmental exposures 
      along the past 5 h of movement, as assessed by GPS. Our models achieved excellent 
      overall accuracy-as high as 0.93 by the end of 16 weeks of tailoring-but this was 
      driven mostly by correct predictions of absence. For predictions of presence, 
      "believability" (positive predictive value, PPV) usually peaked in the high 0.70s 
      toward the end of the 16 weeks. When the prediction target was more rare, PPV was 
      lower. Our findings complement those of other investigators who use machine learning 
      with more broadly based "digital phenotyping" inputs to predict or detect mental and 
      behavioral events. When target events are comparatively subtle, like stress or drug 
      craving, accurate detection or prediction probably needs effortful input from users, 
      not passive monitoring alone. We discuss ways in which accuracy is difficult to 
      achieve or even assess, and warn that high overall accuracy (including high 
      specificity) can mask the abundance of false alarms that low PPV reveals.

TI  - Evaluation of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf Wrist Wearables to Estimate Stress on 
      Students.
LID - 10.3791/57590 [doi]
LID - 57590
AB  - Wearable commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) devices have become popular during the last 
      years to monitor sports activities, primarily among young people. These devices 
      include sensors to gather data on physiological signals such as heart rate, skin 
      temperature or galvanic skin response. By applying data analytics techniques to 
      these kinds of signals, it is possible to obtain estimations of higher-level aspects 
      of human behavior. In the literature, there are several works describing the use of 
      physiological data collected using clinical devices to obtain information on sleep 
      patterns or stress. However, it is still an open question whether data captured 
      using COTS wrist wearables is sufficient to characterize the learners' psychological 
      state in educational settings. This paper discusses a protocol to evaluate stress 
      estimation from data obtained using COTS wrist wearables. The protocol is carried 
      out in two phases. The first stage consists of a controlled laboratory experiment, 
      where a mobile app is used to induce different stress levels in a student by means 
      of a relaxing video, a Stroop Color and Word test, a Paced Auditory Serial Addition 
      test, and a hyperventilation test. The second phase is carried out in the classroom, 
      where stress is analyzed while performing several academic activities, namely 
      attending to theoretical lectures, doing exercises and other individual activities, 
      and taking short tests and exams. In both cases, both quantitative data obtained 
      from COTS wrist wearables and qualitative data gathered by means of questionnaires 
      are considered. This protocol involves a simple and consistent method with a stress 
      induction app and questionnaires, requiring a limited participation of support 
      staff.

TI  - Fear of childbirth (FOC): pregnant women's perceptions towards the impending 
      hospital birth and coping resources - a reconstructive study.
PG  - 231-239
LID - 10.1080/0167482X.2019.1657822 [doi]
AB  - Background: To provide obstetric care which meets the needs of pregnant women with 
      fear of childbirth (FOC), a deeper understanding is required of the beliefs of these 
      women regarding their impending birth and the coping resources they possess to cope 
      with their fear.Methods: Problem-centred interviews were carried out with 12 
      pregnant women who self-reported high FOC. Data analysis was performed using 
      Bohnsack's Documentary Method to reconstruct collective frames of orientation and 
      implicit and explicit orientations in daily practice and interaction.Results: The 
      interviewees see birth as a field of tension between the poles of naturalness and 
      medicalization. Their need for information displays a need to be in control and fear 
      of losing control. Medical and technological monitoring and one-to-one care promote 
      security. Pregnant women with FOC want to know how they can contribute to a 
      physiological birth.Conclusions: Structural, organizational and conceptual changes 
      in obstetric care are needed to cater to the needs of pregnant women with FOC. 
      Alongside the need for evidence-based information about non-medical and medical 
      pain-relief as well as decision-making aids, the provision of a continuity model of 
      midwifery care is important.

TI  - Clinician Identification of Birth Asphyxia Using Intrapartum Cardiotocography Among 
      Neonates With and Without Encephalopathy in New Zealand.
PG  - e1921363
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2019.21363 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Despite improvements in antenatal care and increasing cesarean delivery 
      rates, birth asphyxia leading to neonatal encephalopathy (NE) continues to 
      contribute to neonatal death and long-term neurodevelopmental disability. 
      Cardiotocography (CTG) has been used in labor for several decades to detect a 
      stressed fetus so that delivery can be expedited and NE avoided. OBJECTIVE: To 
      investigate whether experienced clinicians can detect and respond to abnormal 
      readings from CTGs during the penultimate hour before birth in infants with moderate 
      to severe NE but no acute peripartum event. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This 
      case-control study included 10 practicing obstetricians and midwives at maternity 
      hospitals in New Zealand. Participants, who were masked to the perinatal outcome, 
      were asked to assess CTG tracings from 35 neonates with NE and evidence of birth 
      hypoxia (ie, cases) and 105 neonates without NE or birth hypoxia (ie, controls), all 
      of whom were born in 2010 to 2011. Data analysis was conducted from May to December 
      2017. EXPOSURES: Brief clinical details and 1 hour of CTG tracings from the 
      penultimate hour before birth were provided for each baby. Clinicians assessed the 
      CTG tracings and recommended a plan. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Intra-assessor and 
      interassessor agreement on CTG findings and action plans as well as sensitivity (ie, 
      detection of NE) and specificity (ie, ruling out those without NE) for the 
      assessment of abnormal CTG readings leading to immediate action (ie, fetal blood 
      sample or immediate delivery) were reported. RESULTS: A total of 35 infants (mean 
      [SD] gestational age, 40 [1.4] weeks; 16 [45.7%] cesarean deliveries) were 
      designated cases, and 105 infants (mean [SD] gestational age, 39.4 [1.2] weeks; 22 
      [21.0%] cesarean deliveries) were designated controls. No infants had congenital 
      anomalies. The mean (range) sensitivity for detection of abnormal CTG results and 
      for recommending immediate action for all assessors was 75% (63%-91%) and 41% 
      (23%-57%), respectively, with a mean (range) specificity of 67% (53%-77%) and 87% 
      (65%-99%), respectively. A sensitivity analysis including only assessors with 80% or 
      more interassessor agreement only differed from the main analysis by 6% or less 
      (mean [range] sensitivity for detection, 76% [63%-91%]; sensitivity for action plan, 
      36% [25%-49%]; specificity for detection, 71% [53%-77%]; and specificity for action 
      plan, 93% [88%-99%]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Experienced clinicians detected 3 
      of 4 infants who were subsequently diagnosed with NE. Action to expedite delivery 
      was recommended for more than 40% of infants with NE. These results indicate that 
      CTG does not identify all infants at risk of NE, and that there is a need for 
      further investment in new approaches to fetal surveillance in labor.

LID - e1006243
AB  - Learning to predict threat from environmental cues is a fundamental skill in 
      changing environments. This aversive learning process is exemplified by Pavlovian 
      threat conditioning. Despite a plethora of studies on the neural mechanisms 
      supporting the formation of associations between neutral and aversive events, our 
      computational understanding of this process is fragmented. Importantly, different 
      computational models give rise to different and partly opposing predictions for the 
      trial-by-trial dynamics of learning, for example expressed in the activity of the 
      autonomic nervous system (ANS). Here, we investigate human ANS responses to 
      conditioned stimuli during Pavlovian fear conditioning. To obtain precise, 
      trial-by-trial, single-subject estimates of ANS responses, we build on a statistical 
      framework for psychophysiological modelling. We then consider previously proposed 
      non-probabilistic models, a simple probabilistic model, and non-learning models, as 
      well as different observation functions to link learning models with ANS activity. 
      Across three experiments, and both for skin conductance (SCR) and pupil size 
      responses (PSR), a probabilistic learning model best explains ANS responses. 
      Notably, SCR and PSR reflect different quantities of the same model: SCR track a 
      mixture of expected outcome and uncertainty, while PSR track expected outcome alone. 
      In summary, by combining psychophysiological modelling with computational learning 
      theory, we provide systematic evidence that the formation and maintenance of 
      Pavlovian threat predictions in humans may rely on probabilistic inference and 
      includes estimation of uncertainty. This could inform theories of neural 
      implementation of aversive learning.

TI  - The emergency department experience of patients with early pregnancy complications: 
      A qualitative study.
PG  - 798-802
LID - 10.1017/cem.2019.398 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore the experiences and 
      perceptions of care of women treated for early pregnancy complications in a Canadian 
      emergency department (ED) and early pregnancy clinic (EPC). METHODS: We conducted a 
      descriptive qualitative study to understand the perceptions, meanings, and 
      perspectives of women of 18 years and older who presented to the ED or EPC of an 
      urban, tertiary care hospital with early pregnancy complications or loss. Using a 
      semi-structured interview guide, a 45- to 60-minute telephone interview was 
      conducted by a trained qualitative interviewer at 4 to 6 weeks after the ED visit. 
      All interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim for analysis. Data 
      analysis occurred in conjunction with data collection in order to continuously 
      monitor emerging themes and general areas for further exploration. Interviews were 
      conducted until thematic saturation had occurred. RESULTS: Interviews were completed 
      with 30 women between June and August 2018. Three key themes arose: disconnect of 
      the ED's role in the provision of care, normalization of a chaotic healthcare 
      experience, and finding connection through the institution's EPC. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Perspectives of women with early pregnancy complications highlight the ways in which 
      ED care often does not meet the expectations or needs of patients and their 
      families. The emotional complexity of this medical situation is often overlooked by 
      ED staff and can produce encounters that are distressing. However, negative 
      experiences were often mitigated by follow-up care in the institution's EPC.

AB  - Being able to detect stress as it occurs can greatly contribute to dealing with its 
      negative health and economic consequences. However, detecting stress in real life 
      with an unobtrusive wrist device is a challenging task. The objective of this study 
      is to develop a method for stress detection that can accurately, continuously and 
      unobtrusively monitor psychological stress in real life. First, we explore the 
      problem of stress detection using machine learning and signal processing techniques 
      in laboratory conditions, and then we apply the extracted laboratory knowledge to 
      real-life data. We propose a novel context-based stress-detection method. The method 
      consists of three machine-learning components: a laboratory stress detector that is 
      trained on laboratory data and detects short-term stress every 2min; an activity 
      recognizer that continuously recognizes the user's activity and thus provides 
      context information; and a context-based stress detector that uses the outputs of 
      the laboratory stress detector, activity recognizer and other contexts, in order to 
      provide the final decision on 20-min intervals. Experiments on 55days of real-life 
      data showed that the method detects (recalls) 70% of the stress events with a 
      precision of 95%.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Similarities in clinical presentations between epileptic seizures (ES) 
      and psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) produces a risk of misdiagnosis. 
      Video-EEG monitoring (VEM) is the diagnostic gold standard, but involves significant 
      cost and time commitment, suggesting a need for efficient screening tools. METHODS: 
      628 patients were recruited from an inpatient VEM unit; 293 patients with ES, 158 
      with PNES, 31 both ES and PNES, and 146 non-diagnostic. Patients completed the 
      SCL-90-R, a standardised 90-item psychopathology instrument. Bayesian linear models 
      were computed to investigate whether SCL-90-R domain scores or the overall 
      psychopathology factor p differed between groups. Receiver operating characteristic 
      (ROC) curves were computed to investigate the PNES classification accuracy of each 
      domain score and p. A machine learning algorithm was also used to determine which 
      subset of SCL-90-R items produced the greatest classification accuracy. RESULTS: 
      Evidence was found for elevated scores in PNES compared to ES groups in the symptom 
      domains of anxiety (b = 0.47, 95%HDI = [0.10, 0.80]), phobic anxiety (b = 1.32, 
      95%HDI = [0.98, 1.69]), somatisation (b = 0.84, 95%HDI = [0.49, 1.20]), and the 
      general psychopathology factor p (b = 1.35, 95%HDI = [0.86, 1.82]). Of the SCL-90-R 
      domain scores, somatisation produced the highest classification accuracy 
      (AUC = 0.74, 95%CI = [0.69, 0.79]). The genetic algorithm produced a 6-item subset 
      from the SCL-90-R, which produced comparable classification accuracy to the 
      somatisation scores (AUC = 0.73, 95%CI = [0.64, 0.82]). SIGNIFICANCE: Compared to 
      patients with ES, patients with PNES report greater symptoms of somatisation, 
      general anxiety, and phobic anxiety against a background of generally elevated 
      psychopathology. While self-reported psychopathology scores are not accurate enough 
      for diagnosis in isolation, elevated psychopathology in these domains should raise 
      the suspicion of PNES in clinical settings.

AB  - Machine learning analysis of social media data represents a promising way to capture 
      longitudinal environmental influences contributing to individual risk for suicidal 
      thoughts and behaviors. Our objective was to generate an algorithm termed "Suicide 
      Artificial Intelligence Prediction Heuristic (SAIPH)" capable of predicting future 
      risk to suicidal thought by analyzing publicly available Twitter data. We trained a 
      series of neural networks on Twitter data queried against suicide associated 
      psychological constructs including burden, stress, loneliness, hopelessness, 
      insomnia, depression, and anxiety. Using 512,526 tweets from N = 283 suicidal 
      ideation (SI) cases and 3,518,494 tweets from 2655 controls, we then trained a 
      random forest model using neural network outputs to predict binary SI status. The 
      model predicted N = 830 SI events derived from an independent set of 277 suicidal 
      ideators relative to N = 3159 control events in all non-SI individuals with an AUC 
      of 0.88 (95% CI 0.86-0.90). Using an alternative approach, our model generates 
      temporal prediction of risk such that peak occurrences above an individual specific 
      threshold denote a ~7 fold increased risk for SI within the following 10 days 
      (OR = 6.7 ± 1.1, P = 9 × 10(-71)). We validated our model using regionally obtained 
      Twitter data and observed significant associations of algorithm SI scores with 
      county-wide suicide death rates across 16 days in August and in October, 2019, most 
      significantly in younger individuals. Algorithmic approaches like SAIPH have the 
      potential to identify individual future SI risk and could be easily adapted as 
      clinical decision tools aiding suicide screening and risk monitoring using available 
      technologies.

TI  - Phenotypes of Hypertensive Ambulatory Blood Pressure Patterns: Design and Rationale 
      of the ECHORN Hypertension Study.
PG  - 535-544
LID - 10.18865/ed.29.4.535 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the rationale and design of a prospective study of ambulatory 
      blood pressure measurement (ABPM) combined with measurement of contextual factors to 
      identify hypertensive phenotypes in a Caribbean population with high rates of HTN 
      and cardiovascular disease. DESIGN: Prospective, multi-center sub-study. SETTING: 
      Eastern Caribbean Health Outcomes Research Network Cohort (ECHORN) Study, with study 
      sites in Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, Trinidad and Tobago, and Barbados. 
      PARTICIPANTS: Community-residing adults without a diagnosis of HTN and not taking 
      antihypertensive medication. INTERVENTION: Ambulatory BP patterns are assessed using 
      24-hour ABPM. Contextual factors are assessed with: ecological momentary assessment 
      (7-item survey of experiences, exposures and responses associated with daytime BP 
      measurements); actigraphy (capturing physical activity and sleep quality); and 
      self-report surveys (assessing physical and social health, environmental and social 
      stressors and supports). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Phenotypes of contextual factors 
      associated with hypertensive BP patterns (sustained HTN, masked HTN, and nocturnal 
      non-dipping). METHODS AND RESULTS: This study will enroll 500 participants; 
      assessments of blood pressure and contextual factors will be conducted during Waves 
      2 and 3 of the ECHORN parent study, occurring 2 years apart. In Wave 2, we will 
      assess the association between contextual factors and ABPM patterns. Using advanced 
      analytic clustering methods, we will identify phenotypes of contextual factors 
      associated with hypertensive ABPM patterns. We will then test the stability of these 
      phenotypes and their ability to predict change in ABPM patterns between Waves 2 and 
      3. CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of ABPM, and the contextual factors influencing ABPM, can 
      identify unique phenotypes of HTN, which can then be used to develop more 
      precision-based approaches to the prevention, detection and treatment of HTN in 
      high-risk populations.

TI  - Psychological Distress during COVID-19 Lockdown among Dental Students and 
      Practitioners in India: A Cross-Sectional Survey.
PG  - S70-S78
LID - 10.1055/s-0040-1719211 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE:  In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the 
      Indian Government imposed a countrywide lockdown of 21 days from March 25 to April 
      14, 2020, which was further extended to 60 days. The sudden draconian measures 
      changed the delivery of dental education and practice throughout the country. The 
      study aimed to screen for depression during the COVID-19 lockdown and the factors 
      associated with it among dental students and practitioners in highly COVID-19 
      infected states of India. MATERIALS AND METHODS:  The current study is an online 
      cross-sectional survey performed in Delhi NCR, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu during 
      May 2020. The participants were recruited by convenience sampling. The main outcome 
      measure was the screening of depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire 
      (PHQ-9), which was categorized as mild, moderate, and severe depression. The data 
      analysis was performed with IBM SPSS Version 23.0. A multivariable logistic 
      regression model was fitted to identify the independent predictors of depression. 
      RESULTS:  In total, 335 dental students and practitioners participated in the 
      survey. Among this, a significant number of the dental students (54%) and 
      practitioners (44%) scored moderate to severe depression in terms of depression 
      severity according to the PHQ-9 scores. Those who were screened depressed were 
      likely to be males and younger than 30 years old. The results of correlation 
      analysis indicated that worry about the professional growth, concerns regarding 
      setbacks in clinical and research experiences, previous history of mental health 
      issues, and fear of contracting COVID-19 from patients were positively related to 
      higher depression scores in students. Moreover, for practitioners, fear of 
      contracting COVID-19 from the patients scored higher levels of depression. The 
      practitioners who reported less concern about their practice/job post COVID-19 
      lockdown and those who were able to meet their financial expenses during the 
      lockdown were the least likely to be depressed. CONCLUSION:  The results of this 
      study indicate a high level of depression among a significant number of dental 
      students and practitioners. It is important to monitor and address the mental health 
      needs of dental students and practitioners during and after the lockdown.

TI  - Hyperspectral imaging combined with machine learning as a tool to obtain 
      high-throughput plant salt-stress phenotyping.
PG  - 1448-1461
LID - 10.1111/tpj.14597 [doi]
AB  - The rapid selection of salinity-tolerant crops to increase food production in 
      salinized lands is important for sustainable agriculture. Recently, high-throughput 
      plant phenotyping technologies have been adopted that use plant morphological and 
      physiological measurements in a non-destructive manner to accelerate plant breeding 
      processes. Here, a hyperspectral imaging (HSI) technique was implemented to monitor 
      the plant phenotypes of 13 okra (Abelmoschus esculentus L.) genotypes after 2 and 
      7 days of salt treatment. Physiological and biochemical traits, such as fresh 
      weight, SPAD, elemental contents and photosynthesis-related parameters, which 
      require laborious, time-consuming measurements, were also investigated. Traditional 
      laboratory-based methods indicated the diverse performance levels of different okra 
      genotypes in response to salinity stress. We introduced improved plant and leaf 
      segmentation approaches to RGB images extracted from HSI imaging based on deep 
      learning. The state-of-the-art performance of the deep-learning approach for 
      segmentation resulted in an intersection over union score of 0.94 for plant 
      segmentation and a symmetric best dice score of 85.4 for leaf segmentation. 
      Moreover, deleterious effects of salinity affected the physiological and biochemical 
      processes of okra, which resulted in substantial changes in the spectral 
      information. Four sample predictions were constructed based on the spectral data, 
      with correlation coefficients of 0.835, 0.704, 0.609 and 0.588 for SPAD, sodium 
      concentration, photosynthetic rate and transpiration rate, respectively. The results 
      confirmed the usefulness of high-throughput phenotyping for studying plant salinity 
      stress using a combination of HSI and deep-learning approaches.

TI  - Machine-Learning prediction of comorbid substance use disorders in ADHD youth using 
      Swedish registry data.
PG  - 1370-1379
LID - 10.1111/jcpp.13226 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have a 
      high risk for substance use disorders (SUDs). Early identification of at-risk youth 
      would help allocate scarce resources for prevention programs. METHODS: Psychiatric 
      and somatic diagnoses, family history of these disorders, measures of socioeconomic 
      distress, and information about birth complications were obtained from the national 
      registers in Sweden for 19,787 children with ADHD born between 1989 and 1993. We 
      trained (a) a cross-sectional random forest (RF) model using data available by age 
      17 to predict SUD diagnosis between ages 18 and 19; and (b) a longitudinal recurrent 
      neural network (RNN) model with the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to 
      predict new diagnoses at each age. RESULTS: The area under the receiver operating 
      characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.73(95%CI 0.70-0.76) for the random forest model 
      (RF). Removing prior diagnosis from the predictors, the RF model was still able to 
      achieve significant AUCs when predicting all SUD diagnoses (0.69, 95%CI 0.66-0.72) 
      or new diagnoses (0.67, 95%CI: 0.64, 0.71) during age 18-19. For the model 
      predicting new diagnoses, model calibration was good with a low Brier score of 
      0.086. Longitudinal LSTM model was able to predict later SUD risks at as early as 
      2 years age, 10 years before the earliest diagnosis. The average AUC from 
      longitudinal models predicting new diagnoses 1, 2, 5 and 10 years in the future was 
      0.63. CONCLUSIONS: Population registry data can be used to predict at-risk comorbid 
      SUDs in individuals with ADHD. Such predictions can be made many years prior to age 
      of the onset, and their SUD risks can be monitored using longitudinal models over 
      years during child development. Nevertheless, more work is needed to create 
      prediction models based on electronic health records or linked population registers 
      that are sufficiently accurate for use in the clinic.

AB  - The ubiquity and commoditisation of wearable biosensors (fitness bands) has led to a 
      deluge of personal healthcare data, but with limited analytics typically fed back to 
      the user. The feasibility of feeding back more complex, seemingly unrelated measures 
      to users was investigated, by assessing whether increased levels of stress, anxiety 
      and depression (factors known to affect cardiac function) and general health 
      measures could be accurately predicted using heart rate variability (HRV) data from 
      wrist wearables alone. Levels of stress, anxiety, depression and general health were 
      evaluated from subjective questionnaires completed on a weekly or twice-weekly basis 
      by 652 participants. These scores were then converted into binary levels (either 
      above or below a set threshold) for each health measure and used as tags to train 
      Deep Neural Networks (LSTMs) to classify each health measure using HRV data alone. 
      Three data input types were investigated: time domain, frequency domain and typical 
      HRV measures. For mental health measures, classification accuracies of up to 83% and 
      73% were achieved, with five and two minute HRV data streams respectively, showing 
      improved predictive capability and potential future wearable use for tracking stress 
      and well-being.

      Monitoring System During Surgery.
PG  - 451-458
LID - 10.1007/s00268-020-05824-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate perioperative intestinal motility using 
      a novel bowel sound monitoring system in patients undergoing breast and neck 
      surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study enrolled 52 patients who underwent 
      surgery for breast cancer, thyroid tumor, and parathyroid tumor at Kochi Medical 
      School from May 2019 to June 2020. Perioperative bowel sound counts (BSCs) were 
      recorded using a newly developed real-time analysis system in the operating theater. 
      Clinical information and BSC per minute (cpm) data during the preanesthetic, 
      preoperative, operative, postoperative periods, and period in recovery room were 
      obtained to compare between each period. The Mann-Whitney U and Pearson Chi-square 
      tests were used in data analysis. RESULTS: The BSCs during the intraoperative period 
      and postoperative period were significantly decreased compared to those during the 
      preanesthetic period (0.07 cpm versus [vs.]. 1.4 cpm, P = 0.002 and 0.1 cpm vs. 
      1.4 cpm, P = 0.025, respectively). The preoperative BSC with a preanesthetic 
      BSC < 1.4 was significantly lower than that with a preanesthetic BSC ≥ 1.4 (0.40 cpm 
      vs. 1.78 cpm, P = 0.006). The preanesthetic, preoperative, and postoperative BSCs 
      with an intraoperative BSC < 0.07 were significantly lower than those with an 
      intraoperative BSC ≥ 0.07 (0.48 cpm vs. 2.83 cpm, P = 0.007; 0.40 cpm vs. 1.81 cpm, 
      P = 0.008; and 0.07 cpm vs. 0.42 cpm, P = 0.006, respectively). CONCLUSION: The 
      real-time bowel sound analysis system demonstrated an inhibitory effect associated 
      with anesthetic and surgical stress on intestinal motility as the BSC sequentially.

AB  - Mental health is an indicator of emotional, psychological and social well-being of 
      an individual. It determines how an individual thinks, feels and handle situations. 
      Positive mental health helps one to work productively and realize their full 
      potential. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and 
      adolescence through adulthood. Many factors contribute to mental health problems 
      which lead to mental illness like stress, social anxiety, depression, obsessive 
      compulsive disorder, drug addiction, and personality disorders. It is becoming 
      increasingly important to determine the onset of the mental illness to maintain 
      proper life balance. The nature of machine learning algorithms and Artificial 
      Intelligence (AI) can be fully harnessed for predicting the onset of mental illness. 
      Such applications when implemented in real time will benefit the society by serving 
      as a monitoring tool for individuals with deviant behavior. This research work 
      proposes to apply various machine learning algorithms such as support vector 
      machines, decision trees, naïve bayes classifier, K-nearest neighbor classifier and 
      logistic regression to identify state of mental health in a target group. The 
      responses obtained from the target group for the designed questionnaire were first 
      subject to unsupervised learning techniques. The labels obtained as a result of 
      clustering were validated by computing the Mean Opinion Score. These cluster labels 
      were then used to build classifiers to predict the mental health of an individual. 
      Population from various groups like high school students, college students and 
      working professionals were considered as target groups. The research presents an 
      analysis of applying the aforementioned machine learning algorithms on the target 
      groups and also suggests directions for future work.

AB  - The worldwide rise in heatwave frequency poses a threat to plant survival and 
      productivity. Determining the new marker phenotypes that show reproducible response 
      to heat stress and contribute to heat stress tolerance is becoming a priority. In 
      this study, we describe a protocol focusing on the daily changes in plant morphology 
      and photosynthetic performance after exposure to heat stress using an automated 
      noninvasive phenotyping system. Heat stress exposure resulted in an acute reduction 
      of the quantum yield of photosystem II and increased leaf angle. In longer term, the 
      exposure to heat also affected plant growth and morphology. By tracking the recovery 
      period of the WT and mutants impaired in thermotolerance (hsp101), we observed that 
      the difference in maximum quantum yield, quenching, rosette size, and morphology. By 
      examining the correlation across the traits throughout time, we observed that early 
      changes in photochemical quenching corresponded with the rosette size at later 
      stages, which suggests the contribution of quenching to overall heat tolerance. We 
      also determined that 6 h of heat stress provides the most informative insight in 
      plant's responses to heat, as it shows a clear separation between treated and 
      nontreated plants as well as the WT and hsp101. Our work streamlines future 
      discoveries by providing an experimental protocol, data analysis pipeline, and new 
      phenotypes that could be used as targets in thermotolerance screenings.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Despite a long history of ECG-based monitoring of acute ischemia 
      quantified by several widely used clinical markers, the diagnostic performance of 
      these metrics is not yet satisfactory, motivating a data-driven approach to leverage 
      underutilized information in the electrograms. This study introduces a novel metric 
      for acute ischemia, created using a machine learning technique known as Laplacian 
      eigenmaps (LE), and compares the diagnostic and temporal performance of the LE 
      metric against traditional metrics. METHODS: The LE technique uses dimensionality 
      reduction of simultaneously recorded time signals to map them into an abstract space 
      in a manner that highlights the underlying signal behavior. To evaluate the 
      performance of an electrogram-based LE metric compared to current standard 
      approaches, we induced episodes of transient, acute ischemia in large animals and 
      captured the electrocardiographic response using up to 600 electrodes within the 
      intramural and epicardial domains. RESULTS: The LE metric generally detected 
      ischemia earlier than all other approaches and with greater accuracy. Unlike other 
      metrics derived from specific features of parts of the signals, the LE approach uses 
      the entire signal and provides a data-driven strategy to identify features that 
      reflect ischemia. CONCLUSION: The superior performance of the LE metric suggests 
      there are underutilized features of electrograms that can be leveraged to detect the 
      presence of acute myocardial ischemia earlier and more robustly than current 
      methods. SIGNIFICANCE: The earlier detection capabilities of the LE metric on the 
      epicardial surface provide compelling motivation to apply the same approach to ECGs 
      recorded from the body surface.

LID - 10.1007/s10549-020-05953-3 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of delivering a 
      prospective surveillance model in the home over 6 months for women at high risk of 
      developing lymphoedema. METHODS: A single-group, intervention study recruited 20 
      women who had surgical and medical treatment for confirmed node-positive invasive 
      breast cancer and therefore at high risk of developing arm lymphoedema. Participants 
      received a package including Bioimpedance Spectroscopy (BIS) monitoring, lymphoedema 
      education and support to promote self-management and physical activity. RESULTS: 
      Participants adhered to BIS monitoring 74% of the time, and felt extremely confident 
      in using the device. By 6 months, mean BIS L-Dex scores had increased from 3.5 (SD 
      5.6) to 8.4 (SD 11.1); five women (25%) who experienced >  + 6.5 increase in L-Dex 
      score were fitted with a compression garment. Self-reported symptoms and distress 
      decreased by 0.4 out of 10 (95% CI 0.1 to 0.7); number of self-management strategies 
      used increased by 0.6 (95% CI 0.1 to 1.2); and planned exercise increased by 
      2.8 h/week (95% CI 0.4 to 5.2). CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate a prospective 
      surveillance model of care in the home with BIS is feasible and associated with 
      increased self-management. A Phase II randomised trial is warranted as well as 
      research exploring the costs associated with implementing this model of care for 
      high-risk individuals.

AB  - BACKGROUND: AIDS is a worrying public health issue in China and lacks timely and 
      effective surveillance. With the diffusion and adoption of the Internet, the 'big 
      data' aggregated from Internet search engines, which contain users' information on 
      the concern or reality of their health status, provide a new opportunity for AIDS 
      surveillance. This paper uses search engine data to monitor and forecast AIDS in 
      China. METHODS: A machine learning method, artificial neural networks (ANNs), is 
      used to forecast AIDS incidences and deaths. Search trend data related to AIDS from 
      the largest Chinese search engine, Baidu.com, are collected and selected as the 
      input variables of ANNs, and officially reported actual AIDS incidences and deaths 
      are used as the output variable. Three criteria, the mean absolute percentage error, 
      the root mean squared percentage error, and the index of agreement, are used to test 
      the forecasting performance of the ANN method. RESULTS: Based on the monthly time 
      series data from January 2011 to June 2017, this article finds that, under the three 
      criteria, the ANN method can lead to satisfactory forecasting of AIDS incidences and 
      deaths, regardless of the change in the number of search queries. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Despite the inability to self-detect HIV/AIDS through online searching, 
      Internet-based data should be adopted as a timely, cost-effective complement to a 
      traditional AIDS surveillance system.

AB  - We aimed to investigate the role of arginine vasopressin (AVP) acting via the AVPV1 
      receptor in the autonomic cardiovascular responses to cold stress (CS). The study 
      was conducted on adult male Sprague-Dawley rats with telemetry transmitters 
      implanted to monitor heart rate (HR) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) throughout 
      the experiment course. Rats were divided into four groups and were given, 
      respectively, saline (control group), AVPV1 antagonist (V1880) alone, and V1880 
      following the removal of sympathetic outflows using hexamethonium (HEX+V1880) or 
      guanethidine (GUA + V1880). Rats were subjected to the CS stimuli (rapid immersion 
      of the rat's limbs into 4 °C water). Hemodynamic responses were recorded at baseline 
      (PreCS), during CS, and after CS. Data analysis was performed using descriptive 
      methods and spectral and cross-spectral analysis of blood pressure variability (BPV) 
      and heart rate variability (HRV). Key results showed that at PreCS, inhibition of 
      AVPV1 increases SBP and HR as well as very-low-frequency BPV and low-frequency BPV, 
      which is attenuated by hexamethonium (effect on SBP only) and guanethidine (effect 
      on both SBP and HR). HEX+V1880 results in increased high-frequency BPV and 
      attenuated very-low-frequency HRV, while GUA + V1880 results in increased 
      high-frequency HRV and attenuated very-low-frequency HRV. During CS, we observed 
      that SBP and HR, as well as very-low-frequency BPV and low-frequency BPV, were 
      similar in the control group and the group with AVPV1 inhibition, while AVPV1 
      inhibition results in attenuated high-frequency BPV. Furthermore, we observed that 
      changes produced by AVPV1 inhibition alone were affected differently by HEX+V1880 
      and GUA + V1880, particularly in low-frequency HRV and very-low-frequency HRV. The 
      results support that AVPV1 mediates autonomic cardiovascular responses at both 
      baseline and CS stimuli conditions are associated with central mechanism engagement.

TI  - Recognizing hotspots in Brief Eclectic Psychotherapy for PTSD by text and audio 
      mining.

LID - 1726672
AB  - Background: Identifying and addressing hotspots is a key element of imaginal 
      exposure in Brief Eclectic Psychotherapy for PTSD (BEPP). Research shows that 
      treatment effectiveness is associated with focusing on these hotspots and that 
      hotspot frequency and characteristics may serve as indicators for treatment success. 
      Objective: This study aims to develop a model to automatically recognize hotspots 
      based on text and speech features, which might be an efficient way to track patient 
      progress and predict treatment efficacy. Method: A multimodal supervised 
      classification model was developed based on analog tape recordings and transcripts 
      of imaginal exposure sessions of 10 successful and 10 non-successful treatment 
      completers. Data mining and machine learning techniques were used to extract and 
      select text (e.g. words and word combinations) and speech (e.g. speech rate, pauses 
      between words) features that distinguish between 'hotspot' (N = 37) and 
      'non-hotspot' (N = 45) phases during exposure sessions. Results: The developed model 
      resulted in a high training performance (mean F (1)-score of 0.76) but a low testing 
      performance (mean F (1)-score = 0.52). This shows that the selected text and speech 
      features could clearly distinguish between hotspots and non-hotspots in the current 
      data set, but will probably not recognize hotspots from new input data very well. 
      Conclusions: In order to improve the recognition of new hotspots, the described 
      methodology should be applied to a larger, higher quality (digitally recorded) data 
      set. As such this study should be seen mainly as a proof of concept, demonstrating 
      the possible application and contribution of automatic text and audio analysis to 
      therapy process research in PTSD and mental health research in general.

TI  - Facial Muscle Activity Recognition with Reconfigurable Differential 
      Stethoscope-Microphones.
LID - 10.3390/s20174904 [doi]
LID - 4904
AB  - Many human activities and states are related to the facial muscles' actions: from 
      the expression of emotions, stress, and non-verbal communication through 
      health-related actions, such as coughing and sneezing to nutrition and drinking. In 
      this work, we describe, in detail, the design and evaluation of a wearable system 
      for facial muscle activity monitoring based on a re-configurable differential array 
      of stethoscope-microphones. In our system, six stethoscopes are placed at locations 
      that could easily be integrated into the frame of smart glasses. The paper describes 
      the detailed hardware design and selection and adaptation of appropriate signal 
      processing and machine learning methods. For the evaluation, we asked eight 
      participants to imitate a set of facial actions, such as expressions of happiness, 
      anger, surprise, sadness, upset, and disgust, and gestures, like kissing, winkling, 
      sticking the tongue out, and taking a pill. An evaluation of a complete data set of 
      2640 events with 66% training and a 33% testing rate has been performed. Although we 
      encountered high variability of the volunteers' expressions, our approach shows a 
      recall = 55%, precision = 56%, and f1-score of 54% for the user-independent 
      scenario(9% chance-level). On a user-dependent basis, our worst result has an 
      f1-score = 60% and best result with f1-score = 89%. Having a recall ≥60% for 
      expressions like happiness, anger, kissing, sticking the tongue out, and 
      neutral(Null-class).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Development of safe and effective chemopreventive agents is a winning 
      strategy in reducing the morbidity and mortality of breast cancer. The current study 
      was to investigate the mechanism-based chemopreventive potential of a Chinese herb 
      formula Yanghe Huayan (YHHY) Decoction on the classical 
      7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) induced rat mammary carcinogenesis model. 
      METHODS: Female Sprague-Dawley rats at 42 days of age were orally administered with 
      a human equivalent dose of YHHY Decoction at 0.02 ml/g (10 mg/ml) once daily, 
      starting 1 wk. before and 4 wks following DMBA treatment. Mammary tumor occurrence 
      was monitored every day. The length of time before palpable tumor is examined is 
      defined as tumor-free survival time. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) 
      analyses were adopted to identify major chemical compositions of the decoction. 
      Following bioinformatics data mining and experimental analyses were performed to 
      demonstrate the underlying mechanism of action. RESULTS: DMBA animals receiving YHHY 
      Decoction exhibited a significant delay (P = 0.014) and in some animals prevention 
      (P = 0.046) of tumor occurrence without obvious toxicity. Oncogenic myc activation 
      was significantly suppressed in the DMBA-induced rats by the YHHY treatment. Eight 
      major chemical compositions of the decoction were identified and were shown to 
      interfere with multiple tumorigenic pathways simultaneously in the mammary tumors, 
      including inducing tumor apoptosis and up-regulating pro-apoptotic protein Bax and 
      down-regulating anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2; suppressing abnormal cell 
      proliferation and the MAPK/ERK, PI3K/AKT signalings; blocking neo-angiogenesis and 
      the VEGF/KDR signaling, and inhibiting oxidative stress in the mammary tumors. 
      CONCLUSION: The multi-components and multi-targeting properties of the YHHY 
      Decoction support its use as a potent chemopreventive drug in breast cancer.

LID - 221
AB  - Mental state monitoring is a critical component of current and future human-machine 
      interfaces, including semi-autonomous driving and flying, air traffic control, 
      decision aids, training systems, and will soon be integrated into ubiquitous 
      products like cell phones and laptops. Current mental state assessment approaches 
      supply quantitative measures, but their only frame of reference is generic 
      population-level ranges. What is needed are physiological biometrics that are 
      validated in the context of task performance of individuals. Using curated intake 
      experiments, we are able to generate personalized models of three key biometrics as 
      useful indicators of mental state; namely, mental fatigue, stress, and attention. We 
      demonstrate improvements to existing approaches through the introduction of new 
      features. Furthermore, addressing the current limitations in assessing the efficacy 
      of biometrics for individual subjects, we propose and employ a multi-level 
      validation scheme for the biometric models by means of k-fold cross-validation for 
      discrete classification and regression testing for continuous prediction. The paper 
      not only provides a unified pipeline for extracting a comprehensive mental state 
      evaluation from a parsimonious set of sensors (only EEG and ECG), but also 
      demonstrates the use of validation techniques in the absence of empirical data. 
      Furthermore, as an example of the application of these models to novel situations, 
      we evaluate the significance of correlations of personalized biometrics to the 
      dynamic fluctuations of accuracy and reaction time on an unrelated threat detection 
      task using a permutation test. Our results provide a path toward integrating 
      biometrics into augmented human-machine interfaces in a judicious way that can help 
      to maximize task performance.

AB  - AIMS: To determine the accuracy of a wearable sensor to detect and differentiate 
      episodes of self-reported craving and stress in individuals with substance use 
      disorders, and to assess acceptability, barriers, and facilitators to sensor-based 
      monitoring in this population. METHODS: This was an observational mixed methods 
      pilot study. Adults enrolled in an outpatient treatment program for a substance use 
      disorder wore a non-invasive wrist-mounted sensor for four days and self-reported 
      episodes of stress and craving. Continuous physiologic data (accelerometry, skin 
      conductance, skin temperature, and heart rate) were extracted from the sensors and 
      analyzed via various machine learning algorithms. Semi-structured interviews were 
      conducted upon study completion, and thematic analysis was conducted on qualitative 
      data from semi-structured interviews. RESULTS: Thirty individuals completed the 
      protocol, and 43 % (N = 13) were female. A total of 41 craving and 104 stress events 
      were analyzed. The differentiation accuracies of the top performing models were as 
      follows: stress vs. non-stress states 74.5 % (AUC 0.82), craving vs. no-craving 75.7 
      % (AUC 0.82), and craving vs. stress 76.8 % (AUC 0.8). Overall participant 
      perception was positive, and acceptability was high. Emergent themes from the exit 
      interviews included a perception of connectedness and increased mindfulness related 
      to wearing the sensor, both of which were reported as helpful to recovery. Barriers 
      to engagement included interference with other daily wear items, and perceived 
      stigma. CONCLUSIONS: Wearable sensors can be used to objectively differentiate 
      episodes of craving and stress, and individuals in recovery from substance use 
      disorder are accepting of continuous monitoring with these devices.

TI  - Heavy metal Hg stress detection in tobacco plant using hyperspectral sensing and 
      data-driven machine learning methods.

AB  - Accurate detection of heavy metal stress on the growth status of plants is of great 
      concern for agricultural production and management, food security, and ecological 
      environment. A proximal hyperspectral imaging (HSI) system covered the 
      visible/near-infrared (Vis/NIR) region of 400-1000 nm coupled with machine learning 
      methods were employed to discriminate the tobacco plants stressed by different 
      concentration of heavy metal Hg. After acquiring hyperspectral images of tobacco 
      plants stressed by heavy metal Hg with concentration solutions of 0 mg·L(-1) 
      (non-stressed groups), 1, 3, and 5 mg·L(-1) (3 stressed groups), regions of interest 
      (ROIs) of canopy in tobacco plants were identified for spectra processing. 
      Meanwhile, tobacco plant's appearance and microstructure of mesophyll tissue in 
      tobacco leaves were analyzed. After that, clustering effects of the non-stressed and 
      stressed groups were revealed by score plots and score images calculated by 
      principal component analysis (PCA). Then, loadings of PCA and competitive adaptive 
      reweighted sampling (CARS) algorithm were employed to pick effective wavelengths 
      (EWs) for discriminating non-stressed and stressed samples. Partial least squares 
      discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and least-squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) 
      were utilized to estimate the stressed tobacco plants status with different 
      concentrations Hg solutions. The performances of those models were evaluated using 
      confusion matrixes (CMes) and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves. 
      Results demonstrated that PLS-DA models failed to offer relatively good result, and 
      this algorithm was abandoned to classify the stressed and non-stressed groups of 
      tobacco plants. Compared to LS-SVM model based on full spectra (FS-LS-SVM), the 
      LS-SVM model established EWs selected by CARS (CARS-LS-SVM) carried 13 variables 
      provided an accuracy of 100%, which was promising to achieve the qualitative 
      discrimination of the non-stressed and stressed tobacco plants. Meanwhile, for 
      revealing the discrepancy between 3 stressed groups of tobacco plants, the other 
      FS-LS-SVM, PCA-LS-SVM, and CARS-LS-SVM models were setup and offered relatively low 
      accuracies of 55.56%, 51.11% and 66.67%, respectively. Performance of those 3 LS-SVM 
      discriminative models was also poorly performing to differentiate 3 stressed groups 
      of tobacco plants, which might be caused by low concentration of heavy metal and 
      similar canopy (especially in fresh leaves) of plant. The achievements of the 
      research indicated that HSI coupled with machine learning methods had a powerful 
      potential to discriminate tobacco plant stressed by heavy metal Hg.

TI  - Implementing sensor technology applications for workplace health promotion: a needs 
      assessment among workers with physically demanding work.
PG  - 1100
LID - 10.1186/s12889-019-7364-2 [doi]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Workers with physically demanding work may be at risk for injury, 
      illness or other adverse health outcomes due to exposure to different occupational 
      hazards, especially at higher age. Sensor technology applications may be useful in 
      the workplace to unobtrusively measure and monitor work exposures and provide 
      workers with real-time feedback or access to data on demand. Many aspects might 
      impede the implementation of sensor technology applications in the workplace, which 
      should be taken into consideration for a successful implementation. Moreover, needs 
      and preferences of workers regarding the use of sensor technology applications 
      during work performance need to be identified. Therefore, the aim of this study was 
      to identify worker needs and preferences regarding the use of sensor technology 
      applications in the workplace. METHODS: Four on-site focus group sessions were 
      conducted in four different companies among workers with physically demanding work 
      (n = 30). Semi-structured interview schedules were used to identify which work 
      exposures should be measured, by which kind of sensor technology applications, under 
      which (pre)conditions, how to motivate long-term use of sensor technology 
      applications, and which type of feedback is preferred. For data analysis, a 
      content-analysis with an inductive approach was performed. RESULTS: Participants 
      mentioned that they want to use wearable sensor technology applications to measure 
      and monitor physical job demands, occupational heat stress, noise and fatigue. 
      Factors associated with quality, comfort and perceived ease of use were identified 
      as potential barriers for implementation in the workplace. Long-term motivation was 
      attributed to the ability to manage and monitor work exposures, positive feedback 
      and data ownership. Participants indicated a need to both receive real-time feedback 
      and access to data on demand. CONCLUSIONS: Sensor technology applications may 
      support workers with physically demanding work to measure and monitor their work 
      exposures. Potential barriers for implementation such as privacy aspects and 
      quality, comfort and perceived ease of use of sensor technology applications need to 
      be well considered to ensure successful implementation of sensor technology 
      applications in the workplace.

TI  - Non-Destructive Detection of Tea Leaf Chlorophyll Content Using Hyperspectral 
      Reflectance and Machine Learning Algorithms.
LID - 10.3390/plants9030368 [doi]
LID - 368
AB  - Tea trees are kept in shaded locations to increase their chlorophyll content, which 
      influences green tea quality. Therefore, monitoring change in chlorophyll content 
      under low light conditions is important for managing tea trees and producing 
      high-quality green tea. Hyperspectral remote sensing is one of the most frequently 
      used methods for estimating chlorophyll content. Numerous studies based on data 
      collected under relatively low-stress conditions and many hyperspectral indices and 
      radiative transfer models show that shade-grown tea performs poorly. The performance 
      of four machine learning algorithms-random forest, support vector machine, deep 
      belief nets, and kernel-based extreme learning machine (KELM)-in evaluating data 
      collected from tea leaves cultivated under different shade treatments was tested. 
      KELM performed best with a root-mean-square error of 8.94 ± 3.05 μg cm(-2) and 
      performance to deviation values from 1.70 to 8.04 for the test data. These results 
      suggest that a combination of hyperspectral reflectance and KELM has the potential 
      to trace changes in the chlorophyll content of shaded tea leaves.

LID - 175
AB  - BACKGROUND: Health management information system (HMIS) is a system whereby health 
      data are recorded, stored, retrieved and processed to improve decision-making. HMIS 
      data quality should be monitored routinely as production of high quality statistics 
      depends on assessment of data quality and actions taken to improve it. Thus, this 
      study assessed accuracy of the routine HMIS data. METHODS: Facility based 
      cross-sectional study was conducted in Southern Nations Nationalities and People's 
      region in 2017. Document review was done in 163 facilities of different levels. 
      Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) for windows version 20 was used 
      to perform data analysis. Data accuracy was presented in terms of mean and standard 
      deviation of data verification factor. RESULTS: Though inaccuracy was noted for all 
      data elements, 96.9 and 84.7% of facilities reported institutional maternal death 
      and skilled birth attendance within acceptable range respectively while confirmed 
      malaria (45.4%), antenatal care fourth visit (46.6%), postnatal care (55.2%), fully 
      immunized (55.8%), severe acute malnutrition (54.6%) and total malaria (50.3%) were 
      reported accurately only by about half of facilities. Antenatal care fourth visit 
      was over reported by 24% while total malaria was under reported by 28%. Reasons for 
      variations included technical, behavioral and organizational factors. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Majority of facilities over reported services while under reporting diseases. Data 
      quality should be monitored routinely against data quality parameters quantitatively 
      and/or qualitatively to catch-up country's information revolution agenda.

TI  - Psychological Screening and Tracking of Athletes and Digital Mental Health Solutions 
      in a Hybrid Model of Care: Mini Review.
PG  - e22755
LID - 10.2196/22755 [doi]
LID - e22755
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a persistent need for mental ill-health prevention and 
      intervention among at-risk and vulnerable subpopulations. Major disruptions to life, 
      such as the COVID-19 pandemic, present an opportunity for a better understanding of 
      the experience of stressors and vulnerability. Faster and better ways of 
      psychological screening and tracking are more generally required in response to the 
      increased demand upon mental health care services. The argument that mental and 
      physical health should be considered together as part of a biopsychosocial approach 
      is garnering acceptance in elite athlete literature. However, the sporting 
      population are unique in that there is an existing stigma of mental health, an 
      underrecognition of mental ill-health, and engagement difficulties that have 
      hindered research, prevention, and intervention efforts. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this 
      paper are to summarize and evaluate the literature on athletes' increased 
      vulnerability to mental ill-health and digital mental health solutions as a 
      complement to prevention and intervention, and to show relationships between athlete 
      mental health problems and resilience as well as digital mental health screening and 
      tracking, and faster and better treatment algorithms. METHODS: This mini review 
      shapes literature in the fields of athlete mental health and digital mental health 
      by summarizing and evaluating journal and review articles drawn from PubMed Central 
      and the Directory of Open Access Journals. RESULTS: Consensus statements and 
      systematic reviews indicated that elite athletes have comparable rates of mental 
      ill-health prevalence to the general population. However, peculiar subgroups require 
      disentangling. Innovative expansion of data collection and analytics is required to 
      respond to engagement issues and advance research and treatment programs in the 
      process. Digital platforms, machine learning, deep learning, and artificial 
      intelligence are useful for mental health screening and tracking in various 
      subpopulations. It is necessary to determine appropriate conditions for algorithms 
      for use in recommendations. Partnered with real-time automation and machine learning 
      models, valid and reliable behavior sensing, digital mental health screening, and 
      tracking tools have the potential to drive a consolidated, measurable, and balanced 
      risk assessment and management strategy for the prevention and intervention of the 
      sequelae of mental ill-health. CONCLUSIONS: Athletes are an at-risk subpopulation 
      for mental health problems. However, a subgroup of high-level athletes displayed a 
      resilience that helped them to positively adjust after a period of overwhelming 
      stress. Further consideration of stress and adjustments in brief screening tools is 
      recommended to validate this finding. There is an unrealized potential for 
      broadening the scope of mental health, especially symptom and disorder 
      interpretation. Digital platforms for psychological screening and tracking have been 
      widely used among general populations, but there is yet to be an eminent athlete 
      version. Sports in combination with mental health education should address the 
      barriers to help-seeking by increasing awareness, from mental ill-health to positive 
      functioning. A hybrid model of care is recommended, combining traditional 
      face-to-face approaches along with innovative and evaluated digital technologies, 
      that may be used in prevention and early intervention strategies.

AB  - Protein quality control is maintained by a number of integrated cellular pathways 
      that monitor the folding and functionality of the cellular proteome. Defects in 
      these pathways lead to the accumulation of misfolded or faulty proteins that may 
      become insoluble and aggregate over time. Protein aggregates significantly 
      contribute to the development of a number of human diseases such as amyotrophic 
      lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. In vitro, 
      imaging-based, cellular studies have defined key biomolecular components that 
      recognize and clear aggregates; however, no unifying method is available to quantify 
      cellular aggregates, limiting our ability to reproducibly and accurately quantify 
      these structures. Here we describe an ImageJ macro called AggreCount to identify and 
      measure protein aggregates in cells. AggreCount is designed to be intuitive, easy to 
      use, and customizable for different types of aggregates observed in cells. Minimal 
      experience in coding is required to utilize the script. Based on a user-defined 
      image, AggreCount will report a number of metrics: (i) total number of cellular 
      aggregates, (ii) percentage of cells with aggregates, (iii) aggregates per cell, 
      (iv) area of aggregates, and (v) localization of aggregates (cytosol, perinuclear, 
      or nuclear). A data table of aggregate information on a per cell basis, as well as a 
      summary table, is provided for further data analysis. We demonstrate the versatility 
      of AggreCount by analyzing a number of different cellular aggregates including 
      aggresomes, stress granules, and inclusion bodies caused by huntingtin polyglutamine 
      expansion.

AB  - Contactless measurements during the night by a 3-D-camera are less time-consuming in 
      comparison to polysomnography because they do not require sophisticated wiring. 
      However, it is not clear what might be the diagnostic benefit and accuracy of this 
      technology. We investigated 59 persons simultaneously by polysomnography and 
      3-D-camera and visual perceptive computing (19 patients with restless legs syndrome 
      (RLS), 21 patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and 19 healthy volunteers). 
      There was a significant correlation between the apnea hypopnea index (AHI) measured 
      by polysomnography and respiratory events measured with the 3-D-camera in OSA 
      patients (r = 0.823; p < 0.001). The receiver operating characteristic curve yielded 
      a sensitivity of 90% for OSA with a specificity of 71.4%. In RLS patients 72.8% of 
      leg movements confirmed by polysomnography could be detected by 3-D-video and a 
      significant moderate correlation was found between PLM measured by polysomnography 
      and by the 3-D-camera (RLS: r = 0.654; p = 0.004). In total, 95.4% of the sleep 
      epochs were correctly classified by the machine learning approach, but only 32.5% of 
      awake epochs. Further studies should investigate, if this technique might be an 
      alternative to home sleep testing in persons with an increased pre-test probability 
      for OSA.

TI  - The relationship between stress during pregnancy with leptin and cortisol blood 
      concentrations and complications of pregnancy in the mother.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pregnancy is one of the most stressful periods a woman experiences in her 
      life. The present study was an attempt to determine the relationship between 
      maternal stress during pregnancy and cortisol plus maternal serum leptin 
      concentrations as well as pregnancy outcomes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This 
      longitudinal study was conducted on 90 pregnant women in Miandoab city between 2015 
      and 2016. The samples were chosen from mothers with a gestational age of 24 to 28 
      weeks. The participants were asked to complete Cohen’s Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) 
      and a demographic questionnaire and blood samples were taken from them. The mothers 
      were then tracked with four-week intervals until the time of delivery and were asked 
      to complete Cohen’s PSS each time along with a questionnaire related to maternal 
      outcomes. Again, a blood sample was taken at the time of delivery. Data analysis was 
      performed using SPSS 16. Descriptive statistics, Pearson’s correlation coefficient, 
      and the t-test were employed for analysis. RESULTS: A significant relationship was 
      found between maternal stress and preeclampsia (p=0.008). The relationships between 
      preterm childbirth and maternal cortisol concentrations in weeks 24-28 (p=0.015), 
      and between preterm childbirth and maternal leptin concentrations at the time of 
      delivery (p=0.007) were also found to be significant. CONCLUSION: Pregnancy and 
      labor, as physically and mentally stressful events, can affect women’s physiologic 
      and psychological indicators. As a consequence, during pregnancy, the cortisol and 
      leptin index changes in response to the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis 
      and autonomic nervous system under stress.

TI  - Relationship Between Sleep and Behavior in Autism Spectrum Disorder: Exploring the 
      Impact of Sleep Variability.
PG  - 211

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The relationship between sleep (caregiver-reported and 
      actigraphy-measured) and other caregiver-reported behaviors in children and adults 
      with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) was examined, including the use of machine 
      learning to identify sleep variables important in predicting anxiety in ASD. 
      METHODS: Caregivers of ASD (n = 144) and typically developing (TD) (n = 41) 
      participants reported on sleep and other behaviors. ASD participants wore an 
      actigraphy device at nighttime during an 8 or 10-week non-interventional study. Mean 
      and variability of actigraphy measures for ASD participants in the week preceding 
      midpoint and endpoint were calculated and compared with caregiver-reported and 
      clinician-reported symptoms using a mixed effects model. An elastic-net model was 
      developed to examine which sleep measures may drive prediction of anxiety. RESULTS: 
      Prevalence of caregiver-reported sleep difficulties in ASD was approximately 70% and 
      correlated significantly (p < 0.05) with sleep efficiency measured by actigraphy. 
      Mean and variability of actigraphy measures like sleep efficiency and number of 
      awakenings were related significantly (p < 0.05) to ASD symptom severity, 
      hyperactivity and anxiety. In the elastic net model, caregiver-reported sleep, and 
      variability of sleep efficiency and awakenings were amongst the important predictors 
      of anxiety. CONCLUSION: Caregivers report problems with sleep in the majority of 
      children and adults with ASD. Reported problems and actigraphy measures of sleep, 
      particularly variability, are related to parent reported behaviors. Measuring 
      variability in sleep may prove useful in understanding the relationship between 
      sleep problems and behavior in individuals with ASD. These findings may have 
      implications for both intervention and monitoring outcomes in ASD.

TI  - The blenderFace method: video-based measurement of raw movement data during facial 
      expressions of emotion using open-source software.
PG  - 747-768
LID - 10.3758/s13428-018-1085-9 [doi]
AB  - This article proposes an optical measurement of movement applied to data from video 
      recordings of facial expressions of emotion. The approach offers a way to capture 
      motion adapted from the film industry in which markers placed on the skin of the 
      face can be tracked with a pattern-matching algorithm. The method records and 
      postprocesses raw facial movement data (coordinates per frame) of distinctly placed 
      markers and is intended for use in facial expression research (e.g., 
      microexpressions) in laboratory settings. Due to the explicit use of specifically 
      placed, artificial markers, the procedure offers the simultaneous measurement of 
      several emotionally relevant markers in a (psychometrically) objective and 
      artifact-free way, even for facial regions without natural landmarks (e.g., the 
      cheeks). In addition, the proposed procedure is fully based on open-source software 
      and is transparent at every step of data processing. Two worked examples demonstrate 
      the practicability of the proposed procedure: In Study 1(N= 39), the participants 
      were instructed to show the emotions happiness, sadness, disgust, and anger, and in 
      Study 2 (N= 113), they were asked to present both a neutral face and the emotions 
      happiness, disgust, and fear. Study 2 involved the simultaneous tracking of 14 
      markers for approximately 12 min per participant with a time resolution of 33 ms. 
      The measured facial movements corresponded closely to the assumptions of established 
      measurement instruments (EMFACS, FACSAID, Friesen & Ekman, 1983; Ekman & Hager, 
      2002). In addition, the measurement was found to be very precise with sub-second, 
      sub-pixel, and sub-millimeter accuracy.

AB  - India is facing the worst water crisis in its history and major Indian cities which 
      accommodate about 50% of its population will be among highly groundwater stressed 
      cities by 2020. In past few decades, the urban groundwater resources declined 
      significantly due to over exploitation, urbanization, population growth and climate 
      change. To understand the role of these variables on groundwater level fluctuation, 
      we developed a machine learning based modelling approach considering singular 
      spectrum analysis (SSA), mutual information theory (MI), genetic algorithm (GA), 
      artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM). The developed 
      approach was used to predict the groundwater levels in Bengaluru, a densely 
      populated city with declining groundwater water resources. The input data which 
      consist of groundwater levels, rainfall, temperature, NOI, SOI, NIÑO3 and monthly 
      population growth rate were pre-processed using mutual information theory, genetic 
      algorithm and lag analysis. Later, the optimized input sets were used in ANN and SVM 
      to predict monthly groundwater level fluctuations. The results suggest that the 
      machine learning based approach with data pre-processing predict groundwater levels 
      accurately (R > 85%). It is also evident from the results that the pre-processing 
      techniques enhance the prediction accuracy and results were improved for 66% of the 
      monitored wells. Analysis of various input parameters suggest, inclusion of 
      population growth rate is positively correlated with decrease in groundwater levels. 
      The developed approach in this study for urban groundwater prediction can be useful 
      particularly in cities where lack of pipeline/sewage/drainage lines leakage data 
      hinders physical based modelling.

TI  - Integration of Novel Sensors and Machine Learning for Predictive Maintenance in 
      Medium Voltage Switchgear to Enable the Energy and Mobility Revolutions.
LID - 10.3390/s20072099 [doi]
LID - 2099
AB  - The development of renewable energies and smart mobility has profoundly impacted the 
      future of the distribution grid. An increasing bidirectional energy flow stresses 
      the assets of the distribution grid, especially medium voltage switchgear. This 
      calls for improved maintenance strategies to prevent critical failures. Predictive 
      maintenance, a maintenance strategy relying on current condition data of assets, 
      serves as a guideline. Novel sensors covering thermal, mechanical, and partial 
      discharge aspects of switchgear, enable continuous condition monitoring of some of 
      the most critical assets of the distribution grid. Combined with machine learning 
      algorithms, the demands put on the distribution grid by the energy and mobility 
      revolutions can be handled. In this paper, we review the current state-of-the-art of 
      all aspects of condition monitoring for medium voltage switchgear. Furthermore, we 
      present an approach to develop a predictive maintenance system based on novel 
      sensors and machine learning. We show how the existing medium voltage grid 
      infrastructure can adapt these new needs on an economic scale.

TI  - Point process temporal structure characterizes electrodermal activity.
PG  - 26422-26428
LID - 10.1073/pnas.2004403117 [doi]
AB  - Electrodermal activity (EDA) is a direct readout of the body's sympathetic nervous 
      system measured as sweat-induced changes in the skin's electrical conductance. There 
      is growing interest in using EDA to track physiological conditions such as stress 
      levels, sleep quality, and emotional states. Standardized EDA data analysis methods 
      are readily available. However, none considers an established physiological feature 
      of EDA. The sympathetically mediated pulsatile changes in skin sweat measured as EDA 
      resemble an integrate-and-fire process. An integrate-and-fire process modeled as a 
      Gaussian random walk with drift diffusion yields an inverse Gaussian model as the 
      interpulse interval distribution. Therefore, we chose an inverse Gaussian model as 
      our principal probability model to characterize EDA interpulse interval 
      distributions. To analyze deviations from the inverse Gaussian model, we considered 
      a broader model set: the generalized inverse Gaussian distribution, which includes 
      the inverse Gaussian and other diffusion and nondiffusion models; the lognormal 
      distribution which has heavier tails (lower settling rates) than the inverse 
      Gaussian; and the gamma and exponential probability distributions which have lighter 
      tails (higher settling rates) than the inverse Gaussian. To assess the validity of 
      these probability models we recorded and analyzed EDA measurements in 11 healthy 
      volunteers during 1 h of quiet wakefulness. Each of the 11 time series was 
      accurately described by an inverse Gaussian model measured by Kolmogorov-Smirnov 
      measures. Our broader model set offered a useful framework to enhance further 
      statistical descriptions of EDA. Our findings establish that a physiologically based 
      inverse Gaussian probability model provides a parsimonious and accurate description 
      of EDA.

AB  - Groundwater supplies drinking water for over one-third of all Americans. However, 
      with aquifers stressed by overdraft, contamination from land use, and the hydrologic 
      impacts of climate change, identifying reliable sources for new wells is 
      increasingly challenging. Well forecasting is a process in which potential 
      groundwater resources are evaluated for a location of interest. While this process 
      forecasts the depth of each aquifer for a given location, it takes historical 
      groundwater well data from nearby locations into account. Conventionally, well 
      forecasting is done by geological survey professionals by manually analyzing the 
      well data and, that makes the process both time and resource-intensive. This study 
      presents a novel web application that performs well forecasting for any location 
      within the state of Iowa in a matter of seconds utilizing client-side computing 
      instead of expensive professional labor. The web application generates well 
      forecasts by triangulating millions of combinations of historical aquifer depth data 
      of nearby wells stored in a state-level database. The proposed web system also 
      provides water quality information for arsenic, nitrate, and bacteria (total c and 
      fecal coliform) on the same interface with forecasts. The system is open to the 
      public and is aimed to provide a go-to tool for homeowners, well drillers and, 
      authorities to help inform decision-making regarding groundwater well development 
      and water quality monitoring efforts.

AB  - As the challenge of mental health problems such as anxiety and depression increasing 
      today, more convenient, objective, real-time assessing techniques of mental state 
      are in need. The Microsoft Kinect camera is a possible option for contactlessly 
      capturing human gait, which could reflect the walkers' mental state. So we tried to 
      propose a novel method for monitoring individual's anxiety and depression based on 
      the Kinect-recorded gait pattern. In this study, after finishing the 7-item 
      Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and the 9-item Patient Health 
      Questionnaire (PHQ-9), 179 participants were required to walked on the footpath 
      naturally while shot by the Kinect cameras. Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) were 
      conducted to extract features from the Kinect-captured gait data after 
      preprocessing, and different machine learning algorithms were used to train the 
      regression models recognizing anxiety and depression levels, and the classification 
      models detecting the cases with specific depressive symptoms. The predictive 
      accuracies of the regression models achieved medium to large level: The correlation 
      coefficient between predicted and questionnaire scores reached 0.51 on anxiety (by 
      epsilon-Support Vector Regression, e-SVR) and 0.51 on depression (by Gaussian 
      Processes, GP). The predictive accuracies could be even higher, 0.74 on anxiety (by 
      GP) and 0.64 on depression (by GP), while training and testing the models on the 
      female sample. The classification models also showed effectiveness on detecting the 
      cases with some symptoms. These results demonstrate the possibility to recognize 
      individual's questionnaire measured anxiety/depression levels and some depressive 
      symptoms based on Kinect-recorded gait data through machine learning method. This 
      approach shows the potential to develop non-intrusive, low-cost methods for 
      monitoring individuals' mental health in real time.

AB  - Lactating cows and nulliparous heifers are in distinctive and unique physiological 
      conditions when they are approaching the planned time of breeding, at approximately 
      60 days in milk and 13-15 months of age, respectively. This study aimed to profile 
      the metabolic milieu in heifers (N = 14) and lactating cows (N = 15) in the weeks 
      leading up to planned time of breeding. All cows were followed for a period of 15 
      weeks, from 3 weeks pre-calving to 12 weeks post-calving, while heifers were 
      monitored for a period of 4 weeks leading up to the tentative week of breeding 
      (pre-breeding period). For data analysis, we further divided cows into primiparous 
      (N = 8) and multiparous (N = 7) cows owing to the significant difference in their 
      milk yield. Assessment of reproductive performance showed that primiparous and 
      multiparous cows tended to have lower pregnancy rates compared to heifers (P < 0.1). 
      Plasma concentrations of β-hydroxybutyric acid were about 2-fold higher in 
      multiparous cows than those of heifers in the week leading up to planned time of 
      breeding (P < 0.05). Total bile acid levels during the pre-breeding period were 
      higher in all lactating cows compared to heifers (P < 0.05) and glucose levels were 
      lower in lactating cows (P < 0.05). Triglyceride concentrations were lowest in 
      multiparous cows compared to both primiparous cows and nulliparous heifers 
      (P < 0.05). In addition, lactating cows had higher concentrations of 
      total-cholesterol and the high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein 
      compared to heifers (P < 0.05). Conversely, concentrations of very low-density 
      lipoprotein were lower in multiparous cows than primiparous cows and nulliparous 
      heifers (P < 0.05). There were no differences in plasma glutathione levels, as 
      measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, between the groups, but 
      the ferric reducing ability of plasma was higher in lactating cows compared to 
      heifers (P < 0.05). These data establish the differences in the profile of metabolic 
      and oxidative markers during the period approaching planned time of breeding in 
      lactating cows compared to nulliparous heifers. As certain metabolites in the plasma 
      have been shown to be represented in the ovarian follicular microenvironment, the 
      unique profiles may influence reproductive performance in dairy cattle in different 
      physiological stages.

AB  - This study assessed the feasibility of an NMR metabolomics approach coupled to 
      multivariate data analysis to monitor the naturally present or stresses-elicited 
      metabolites from a long-term (>170 days) culture of the dinoflagellate marine 
      microalgae Amphidinium carterae grown in a fiberglass paddlewheel-driven raceway 
      photobioreactor. Metabolic contents, in particular, in two members of the amphidinol 
      family, amphidinol A and its 7-sulfate derivative amphidinol B (referred as APDs), 
      and other compounds of interest (fatty acids, carotenoids, oxylipins, etc.) were 
      evaluated by altering concentration levels of the f/2 medium nutrients and daily 
      mean irradiance. Operating with a 24 h sinusoidal light cycle allowed a 3-fold 
      increase in APD production, which was also detected by an increase in hemolytic 
      activity of the methanolic extract of A. carterae biomass. The presence of APDs was 
      consistent with the antitumoral activity measured in the methanolic extracts of the 
      biomass. Increased daily irradiance was accompanied by a general decrease in 
      pigments and an increase in SFAs (saturated fatty acids), MUFAs (monounsaturated 
      fatty acids), and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid), while increased nutrient availability 
      lead to an increase in sugar, amino acid, and PUFA ω-3 contents and pigments and a 
      decrease in SFAs and MUFAs. NMR-based metabolomics is shown to be a fast and 
      suitable method to accompany the production of APD and bioactive compounds without 
      the need of tedious isolation methods and bioassays. The two APD compounds were 
      chemically identified by spectroscopic NMR and spectrometric ESI-IT MS (electrospray 
      ionization ion trap mass spectrometry) and ESI-TOF MS (ESI time-of-flight mass 
      spectrometry) methods.

AB  - The measurement of the respiration rate (RR) in cattle is a valuable tool for 
      monitoring health status. Thus, an RR sensor can be essential for stress detection, 
      especially heat stress. Heat stress leads to a deviation of the normal RR and 
      results in a decrease of milk production and fertility. Therefore, continuous 
      monitoring of the RR can help early detection of heat stress and, thus, initiate 
      timely counteractive actions to minimize physical stress. The most common method to 
      measure the RR in cattle is to count the flank movement visually; however, this 
      method is time-consuming and labor-intensive. In addition, the continuous 
      measurement of the RR is difficult to implement and can be physically strenuous. 
      Therefore, a device based on a differential pressure sensor that can record RR 
      automatically has been developed to make continuous long-term studies possible. The 
      aim of this study was to validate the data measured by the device with the help of a 
      reference method. The reference method used was counting the flank movements of a 
      total of 6 cows (Holstein-Friesian). The rear flank movements of each cow were 
      recorded by a camera and counted independently of the device by an observer. Eight 
      videos of 1 min each were recorded per cow. The data analysis was done with cows in 
      3 different body positions: dozing, lying, and standing. A total of 48 RR 
      measurements of the device were compared with the counted RR frequencies of the 
      video recording. The results were highly correlated during dozing [correlation 
      coefficient (r) = 0.92, n = 13], lying (r = 0.98, n = 15), and standing (r = 0.99, n 
      = 20). The evaluation showed that the device is suitable for automated RR counting. 
      Further development of a marketable device is planned.

AB  - Boldt, P, Knechtle, B, Nikolaidis, P, Lechleitner, C, Wirnitzer, G, Leitzmann, C, 
      and Wirnitzer, K. Sex differences in the health status of endurance runners: results 
      from the NURMI study (step 2). J Strength Cond Res 33(7): 1929-1940, 2019-Optimized 
      endurance performance is closely linked to a good health status (HS), which is 
      crucially affected by sex. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate 
      sex differences in the HS of endurance runners of different distances. A total of 
      281 female and male recreational runners completed an online survey. Health status 
      included body mass, smoking habits, felt stress, chronic diseases, allergies, 
      intolerances, medication intake, supplement intake, health-related food choice, 
      enhancement substance use, and health care utilization. Data analysis was performed 
      using the independent t-test and chi-squared test with Cohen's d and Cramer's phi 
      (φ) to evaluate the magnitude of the differences and associations. There were 159 
      female and 122 male participants, with 173 runners meeting the inclusion criteria, 
      among them 103 half-marathoners, and 70 marathoners and ultramarathoners, of which 
      one hundred eight 10-km runners were defined as the control group. Statistical 
      significance (p < 0.05) was determined for the following findings: there was a 
      higher prevalence of hypothyroidism in women; the use of thyroid medication and the 
      intake of hormones and supplements prescribed by a doctor were more common in women; 
      men reported more often a decrease in body mass due to running training, and women 
      reported more often choosing food to obtain phytochemicals. There was no 
      statistically significant association (p > 0.05) between sex and body mass change 
      because of a change in diet, smoking habits, felt stress, chronic diseases except 
      hypothyroidism, allergies, food intolerances, intake of antihypertensives and 
      cholesterol-lowering medication, intake of performance-enhancing substances, or 
      health care utilization. Both female and male runners had a good HS with no 
      difference between sexes. Based on the findings of this study, monitoring thyroid 
      parameters and vitamin D levels is required in female athletes, whereas adequate 
      body mass control strategies are needed for their male counterparts.

AB  - There are tremendous opportunities to advance science, clinical care, sports 
      performance, and societal health if we are able to develop tools for monitoring 
      musculoskeletal loading (e.g., forces on bones or muscles) outside the lab. While 
      wearable sensors enable non-invasive monitoring of human movement in applied 
      situations, current commercial wearables do not estimate tissue-level loading on 
      structures inside the body. Here we explore the feasibility of using wearable 
      sensors to estimate tibial bone force during running. First, we used lab-based data 
      and musculoskeletal modeling to estimate tibial force for ten participants running 
      across a range of speeds and slopes. Next, we converted lab-based data to signals 
      feasibly measured with wearables (inertial measurement units on the foot and shank, 
      and pressure-sensing insoles) and used these data to develop two multi-sensor 
      algorithms for estimating peak tibial force: one physics-based and one machine 
      learning. Additionally, to reflect current running wearables that utilize running 
      impact metrics to infer musculoskeletal loading or injury risk, we estimated tibial 
      force using a commonly measured impact metric, the ground reaction force vertical 
      average loading rate (VALR). Using VALR to estimate peak tibial force resulted in a 
      mean absolute percent error of 9.9%, which was no more accurate than a theoretical 
      step counter that assumed the same peak force for every running stride. Our 
      physics-based algorithm reduced error to 5.2%, and our machine learning algorithm 
      reduced error to 2.6%. Further, to gain insights into how force estimation accuracy 
      relates to overuse injury risk, we computed bone damage expected due to a given 
      loading cycle. We found that modest errors in tibial force translated into large 
      errors in bone damage estimates. For example, a 9.9% error in tibial force using 
      VALR translated into 104% error in estimated bone damage. Encouragingly, the 
      physics-based and machine learning algorithms reduced damage errors to 41% and 18%, 
      respectively. This study highlights the exciting potential to combine wearables, 
      musculoskeletal biomechanics and machine learning to develop more accurate tools for 
      monitoring musculoskeletal loading in applied situations.

TI  - RiboToolkit: an integrated platform for analysis and annotation of ribosome 
      profiling data to decode mRNA translation at codon resolution.
PG  - W218-W229
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkaa395 [doi]
AB  - Ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) is a powerful technology for globally monitoring RNA 
      translation; ranging from codon occupancy profiling, identification of actively 
      translated open reading frames (ORFs), to the quantification of translational 
      efficiency under various physiological or experimental conditions. However, 
      analyzing and decoding translation information from Ribo-seq data is not trivial. 
      Although there are many existing tools to analyze Ribo-seq data, most of these tools 
      are designed for specific or limited functionalities and an easy-to-use integrated 
      tool to analyze Ribo-seq data is lacking. Fortunately, the small size (26-34 nt) of 
      ribosome protected fragments (RPFs) in Ribo-seq and the relatively small amount of 
      sequencing data greatly facilitates the development of such a web platform, which is 
      easy to manipulate for users with or without bioinformatic expertise. Thus, we 
      developed RiboToolkit (http://rnabioinfor.tch.harvard.edu/RiboToolkit), a 
      convenient, freely available, web-based service to centralize Ribo-seq data 
      analyses, including data cleaning and quality evaluation, expression analysis based 
      on RPFs, codon occupancy, translation efficiency analysis, differential translation 
      analysis, functional annotation, translation metagene analysis, and identification 
      of actively translated ORFs. Besides, easy-to-use web interfaces were developed to 
      facilitate data analysis and intuitively visualize results. Thus, RiboToolkit will 
      greatly facilitate the study of mRNA translation based on ribosome profiling.

TI  - A review of dashboards for data analytics in nursing.
PG  - 545-9
LID - 10.1097/CIN.0000000000000106 [doi]
AB  - Dashboards are data-driven clinical decision support tools used to analyze data from 
      multiple databases using easy-to-read, color-coded graphical displays, much like the 
      dashboards of automobiles. Dashboards can be used to promote data-driven decision 
      making and improve adherence to evidence-based practice guidelines. The purpose of 
      this article was to provide a review of dashboards used to query electronic health 
      records for the purpose of guiding clinical practice and research. An inductive 
      content analysis approach was used to identify emerging themes directly from the 
      literature. Five basic dashboard properties identified include the type of database 
      integration, visual properties, purpose, time focus (ie, retrospective, real time, 
      or predictive), and type of process monitored. These dashboard properties are 
      determined by the characteristics of the specific organization, user, and purpose of 
      data analysis. Using dashboards to perform automated analytical reviews of clinical 
      data will prove more efficient when data elements stored in electronic health 
      records become standardized. Other limitations of dashboard use include user 
      anxiety, information overload, and technology overload. The increased use of 
      electronic documentation in healthcare settings will provide a wealth of data, and 
      dashboards will play a pivotal role in converting these data into actionable 
      knowledge.

AB  - AIMS: To assess changes in glucose metrics and their association with psychological 
      distress and lifestyle changes in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) using flash 
      glucose monitoring (FGM) during lockdown following severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus 2 outbreak. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Single-centre, observational, 
      retrospective study enrolling T1D patients who attended a remote visit on April 2020 
      at the Endocrinology division of the University Hospital Policlinico Consorziale, 
      Bari, Italy. Lockdown-related changes in physical activity level and dietary habits 
      were assessed on a semi-quantitative basis. Changes in general well-being were 
      assessed by the General Health Questionnaire-12 items with a binary scoring system. 
      Glucose metrics were obtained from the Libreview platform for the first 2 weeks of 
      February 2020 (T0) and the last 2 weeks before the phone visit (T1). RESULTS: Out of 
      84 patients assessed for eligibility, 48 had sufficient FGM data to be included in 
      the analysis. FGM data analysis revealed significant reductions in coefficient of 
      variation, number of hypoglycaemic events, and time below range, while no changes 
      were found in time in range, time above range, mean sensor glucose, and glucose 
      management indicator. Moreover, the frequency of sweets consumption was inversely 
      related to the occurrence of hypoglycaemic events during lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Lockdown-related lifestyle changes, albeit unhealthy, may lead to reduction in 
      FGM-derived measures of hypoglycaemia and glycaemic variability in patients with 
      T1D.

AB  - Early diagnosis and prevention play a crucial role in the treatment of patients with 
      ARDS. The definition of ARDS requires an arterial blood gas to define the ratio of 
      partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2 
      ratio). However, many patients with ARDS do not have a blood gas measured, which may 
      result in under-diagnosis of the condition. Using data from MIMIC-III Database, we 
      propose an algorithm based on patient non-invasive physiological parameters to 
      estimate P/F levels to aid in the diagnosis of ARDS disease. The machine learning 
      algorithm was combined with the filter feature selection method to study the 
      correlation of various noninvasive parameters from patients to identify the ARDS 
      disease. Cross-validation techniques are used to verify the performance of 
      algorithms for different feature subsets. XGBoost using the optimal feature subset 
      had the best performance of ARDS identification with the sensitivity of 84.03%, the 
      specificity of 87.75% and the AUC of 0.9128. For the four machine learning 
      algorithms, reducing a certain number of features, AUC can still above 0.8. Compared 
      to Rice Linear Model, this method has the advantages of high reliability and 
      continually monitoring the development of patients with ARDS.

TI  - Single-Item Self-Report Measures of Team-Sport Athlete Wellbeing and Their 
      Relationship With Training Load: A Systematic Review.
PG  - 944-953
LID - 10.4085/1062-6050-0528.19 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Single-item athlete self-report measures consist of a single question to 
      assess a dimension of wellbeing. These methods are recommended and frequently used 
      for athlete monitoring, yet their uniformity has not been well assessed, and we have 
      a limited understanding of their relationship with measures of training load. 
      OBJECTIVE: To investigate the applications and designs of single-item self-report 
      measures used in monitoring team-sport athletes and present the relationship between 
      these measures and measures of training load. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Scopus, and 
      SPORTDiscus were searched between inception and March 2019. STUDY SELECTION: 
      Articles were included if they concerned adult athletes from field- or court-sport 
      domains, if athlete well-being was measured using a single-item self-report, and if 
      the relationship with a measure of modifiable training load was investigated over at 
      least 7 days. DATA EXTRACTION: Data related to participant characteristics, 
      self-report measures, training load measures, and statistical analysis and outcomes 
      were extracted by 2 authors (C.D. and C.D.). DATA SYNTHESIS: A total of 21 studies 
      were included in the analysis. A narrative synthesis was conducted. The measures 
      used most frequently were muscle soreness, fatigue, sleep quality, stress, and mood. 
      All measures presented various relationships with metrics of training load from no 
      association to a very large association, and the associations were predominantly 
      trivial to moderate in the studies with the largest numbers of observations. 
      Relationships were largely negative associations. CONCLUSIONS: The implications of 
      this review should be considered by users in the application and clinical utility of 
      single-item self-report measures in athlete monitoring. Great emphasis has been 
      placed on examining the relationship between subjective and objective measures of 
      training load. Although the relationship is still unclear, such an association may 
      not be expected or useful. Researchers should consider the measurement properties of 
      single-item self-report measures and seek to establish their relationship with 
      clinically meaningful outcomes. As such, further study is required to inform 
      practitioners on the appropriate objective application of data from single-item 
      self-report measures.

      Stress in Cerebral Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury.
PG  - 13382-13389
LID - 10.1021/acsnano.9b06780 [doi]
AB  - Oxidative stress is one of the important mechanisms in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion 
      (I/R) injury. Antioxidants with high brain accumulation are highly desired to help 
      prevent cerebral I/R injury. Herein, intrathecal injection of polyoxometalate (POM) 
      nanoclusters as nano-antioxidants with preferential brain uptake were applied for 
      neuronal protection in cerebral I/R injury. Using powerful positron emission 
      tomography imaging, the uptake of nano-antioxidants in the brain was non-invasively 
      and real-timely monitored. Our results demonstrated that POM nanoclusters rapidly 
      reached the ischemic penumbra after intrathecal injection and effectively scavenged 
      reactive oxygen species (ROS) for inhibiting oxidative stress. The infarct size was 
      reduced, and neurological function was restored in cerebral I/R injury rat models. 
      As a proof-of-concept, the intrathecal injection of nano-antioxidants is an 
      excellent therapeutic strategy to ameliorate cerebral I/R injury.

AB  - Mitochondria play a crucial role in energetic metabolism, signaling pathways, and 
      overall cell viability. They are in the first line in facing cellular energy 
      requirements in stress conditions, such as in response to xenobiotic exposure. 
      Recently, a novel regulatory key role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in important signaling 
      pathways in mitochondria has been proposed. Consequently, alteration in miRNAs 
      expression by xenobiotics could outcome into mitochondrial dysfunction, reactive 
      oxygen species overexpression, and liberation of apoptosis or necrosis activating 
      proteins. The aim of this review is to show the highlights about 
      mitochondria-associated miRNAs in cellular processes exposed to xenobiotic stress in 
      different cell types involved in detoxification processes or sensitive to 
      environmental hazards in marine sentinel organisms and mammals.

TI  - Neurocognitive predictors of self-reported reward responsivity and approach 
      motivation in depression: A data-driven approach.
PG  - 682-697
LID - 10.1002/da.23042 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Individual differences in reward-related processes, such as reward 
      responsivity and approach motivation, appear to play a role in the nature and course 
      of depression. Prior work suggests that cognitive biases for valenced information 
      may contribute to these reward processes. Yet there is little work examining how 
      biased attention, processing, and memory for positively and negatively valenced 
      information may be associated with reward-related processes in samples with 
      depression symptoms. METHODS: We used a data-driven, machine learning (elastic net) 
      approach to identify the best predictors of self-reported reward-related processes 
      using multiple tasks of attention, processing, and memory for valenced information 
      measured across behavioral, eye tracking, psychophysiological, and computational 
      modeling approaches (n = 202). Participants were adults (ages 18-35) who ranged in 
      depression symptom severity from mild to severe. RESULTS: Models predicted between 
      5.0-12.2% and 9.7-28.0% of held-out test sample variance in approach motivation and 
      reward responsivity, respectively. Low self-referential processing of positively 
      valenced information was the most robust, albeit modest, predictor of low approach 
      motivation and reward responsivity. CONCLUSIONS: Self-referential processing of 
      positive information is the strongest predictor of reward responsivity and approach 
      motivation in a sample ranging from mild to severe depression symptom severity. 
      Experiments are now needed to clarify the causal relationship between 
      self-referential processing of positively valenced information and reward processes 
      in depression.

LID - 1728
AB  - Background: Clinical decision support (CDS) systems have emerged as tools providing 
      intelligent decision making to address challenges of critical care. CDS systems can 
      be based on existing guidelines or best practices; and can also utilize machine 
      learning to provide a diagnosis, recommendation, or therapy course. Methods: This 
      research aimed to identify evidence-based study designs and outcome measures to 
      determine the clinical effectiveness of clinical decision support systems in the 
      detection and prediction of hemodynamic instability, respiratory distress, and 
      infection within critical care settings. PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov and Cochrane 
      Database of Systematic Reviews were systematically searched to identify primary 
      research published in English between 2013 and 2018. Studies conducted in the USA, 
      Canada, UK, Germany and France with more than 10 participants per arm were included. 
      Results: In studies on hemodynamic instability, the prediction and management of 
      septic shock were the most researched topics followed by the early prediction of 
      heart failure. For respiratory distress, the most popular topics were pneumonia 
      detection and prediction followed by pulmonary embolisms. Given the importance of 
      imaging and clinical notes, this area combined Machine Learning with image analysis 
      and natural language processing. In studies on infection, the most researched areas 
      were the detection, prediction, and management of sepsis, surgical site infections, 
      as well as acute kidney injury. Overall, a variety of Machine Learning algorithms 
      were utilized frequently, particularly support vector machines, boosting techniques, 
      random forest classifiers and neural networks. Sensitivity, specificity, and ROC AUC 
      were the most frequently reported performance measures. Conclusion: This review 
      showed an increasing use of Machine Learning for CDS in all three areas. Large 
      datasets are required for training these algorithms; making it imperative to 
      appropriately address, challenges such as class imbalance, correct labelling of data 
      and missing data. Recommendations are formulated for the development and successful 
      adoption of CDS systems.

TI  - Reducing False Alarm Rates in Neonatal Intensive Care: A New Machine Learning 
      Approach.
PG  - 285-290
LID - 10.1007/978-3-030-34461-0_36 [doi]
AB  - In neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), 87.5% of alarms by the monitoring system 
      are false alarms, often caused by the movements of the neonates. Such false alarms 
      are not only stressful for the neonates as well as for their parents and caregivers, 
      but may also lead to longer response times in real critical situations. The aim of 
      this project was to reduce the rates of false alarms by employing machine learning 
      algorithms (MLA), which intelligently analyze data stemming from standard 
      physiological monitoring in combination with cerebral oximetry data (in-house built, 
      OxyPrem). MATERIALS & METHODS: Four popular MLAs were selected to categorize the 
      alarms as false or real: (i) decision tree (DT), (ii) 5-nearest neighbors (5-NN), 
      (iii) naïve Bayes (NB) and (iv) support vector machine (SVM). We acquired and 
      processed monitoring data (median duration (SD): 54.6 (± 6.9) min) of 14 preterm 
      infants (gestational age: 26 6/7 (± 2 5/7) weeks). A hybrid method of filter and 
      wrapper feature selection generated the candidate subset for training these four 
      MLAs. RESULTS: A high specificity of >99% was achieved by all four approaches. DT 
      showed the highest sensitivity (87%). The cerebral oximetry data improved the 
      classification accuracy. DISCUSSION & CONCLUSION: Despite a (as yet) low amount of 
      data for training, the four MLAs achieved an excellent specificity and a promising 
      sensitivity. Presently, the current sensitivity is insufficient since, in the NICU, 
      it is crucial that no real alarms are missed. This will most likely be improved by 
      including more subjects and data in the training of the MLAs, which makes pursuing 
      this approach worthwhile.

AB  - Background: Studies that identify children after acute trauma and prospectively 
      track risk/protective factors and trauma responses over time are resource-intensive; 
      small sample sizes often limit power and generalizability. The Prospective studies 
      of Acute Child Trauma and Recovery (PACT/R) Data Archive was created to facilitate 
      more robust integrative cross-study data analyses. Objectives: To (a) describe 
      creation of this research resource, including harmonization of key variables; (b) 
      describe key study- and participant-level variables; and (c) examine retention to 
      follow-up across studies. Methods: For the first 30 studies in the Archive, we 
      described study-level (design factors, retention rates) and participant-level 
      (demographic, event, traumatic stress) variables. We used Chi square or ANOVA to 
      examine study- and participant-level variables potentially associated with 
      retention. Results: These 30 prospective studies (N per study = 50 to 568; overall N 
      = 5499) conducted by 15 research teams in 5 countries enrolled children exposed to 
      injury (46%), disaster (24%), violence (13%), traffic accidents (10%), or other 
      acute events. Participants were school-age or adolescent (97%), 60% were male, and 
      approximately half were of minority ethnicity. Using harmonized data from 22 
      measures, 24% reported significant traumatic stress ≥1 month post-event. Other 
      commonly assessed outcomes included depression (19 studies), 
      internalizing/externalizing symptoms (19), and parent mental health (19). Studies 
      involved 2 to 5 research assessments; 80% of participants were retained for ≥2 
      assessments. At the study level, greater retention was associated with more planned 
      assessments. At the participant level, adolescents, minority youth, and those of 
      lower socioeconomic status had lower retention rates. Conclusion: This project 
      demonstrates the feasibility and value of bringing together traumatic stress 
      research data and making it available for re-use. As an ongoing research resource, 
      the Archive can promote 'FAIR' data practices and facilitate integrated analyses to 
      advance understanding of child traumatic stress.

TI  - A generalised additive model to characterise dairy cows' responses to heat stress.
PG  - 418-424
LID - 10.1017/S1751731119001721 [doi]
AB  - Heat stress is one of the most critical issues jeopardising animal welfare and 
      productivity during the warm season in dairy cattle farms. The global trend of 
      increase in average and peak temperatures is making the problem more and more 
      serious. Many devices have been introduced in livestock farms to monitor and control 
      temperature-humidity index, as well as animal behaviour and production parameters. 
      The consequent availability of collected databases has increasingly enhanced the 
      research aimed to understand the consequences of heat stress in cattle, in relation 
      to genetic, reproductive, productive and behavioural features. Moreover, these 
      investigations laid the foundations for the development, calibration, validation and 
      test of numerical models quantifying the individual responses to heat stress 
      conditions. In this work, a generalised additive model with mixed effects has been 
      developed to analyse the relationship between milk production, animal behaviour and 
      environmental parameters based on data surveyed in 2016 in an Italian dairy farm. 
      Each cow has been characterised in terms of her response to heat conditions, and the 
      results led to define three classes of susceptibility to heat stress within the 
      herd. These attributes have then been related to the various phenotypic parameters 
      collected by the precision livestock farming devices used in the farm. The study 
      provides a model to understand the effects of heat stress conditions on individual 
      animals in relation to the main parameters describing their rearing conditions; 
      moreover, the results contribute to improve the herd management by lending 
      indications to define targeted treatments according to the cow's characteristics.

TI  - Argus: An open-source and flexible software application for automated quantification 
      of behavior during social interaction in adult zebrafish.
PG  - 727-746
LID - 10.3758/s13428-018-1083-y [doi]
AB  - Zebrafish show great potential for behavioral neuroscience. Promising lines of 
      research, however, require the development and validation of software tools that 
      will allow automated and cost-effective behavioral analysis. Building on our 
      previous work with the RealFishTracker (in-house-developed tracking system), we 
      present Argus, a data extraction and analysis tool built in the open-source R 
      language for behavioral researchers without any expertise in R. Argus includes a 
      new, user-friendly, and efficient graphical user interface, instead of a 
      command-line interface, and offers simplicity and flexibility in measuring complex 
      zebrafish behavior through customizable parameters. In this article, we compare 
      Argus with Noldus EthoVision and Noldus The Observer, to validate this new system. 
      All three software applications were originally designed to quantify the behavior of 
      a single subject. We first also performed an analysis of the movement of individual 
      fish and compared the performance of the three software applications. Next we 
      computed and quantified the behavioral variables that characterize dyadic 
      interactions between zebrafish. We found that Argus and EthoVision extract similar 
      absolute values and patterns of changes in these values for several behavioral 
      measures, including speed, freezing, erratic movement, and interindividual distance. 
      In contrast, the manual coding of behavior in The Observer showed weaker 
      correlations with the two tracking methods (EthoVision and Argus). Thus, Argus is a 
      novel, cost-effective, and customizable method for the analysis of adult zebrafish 
      behavior that may be utilized for the behavioral quantification of both single and 
      dyadic interacting subjects, but further sophistication will be needed for the 
      proper identification of complex motor patterns, measures that a human observers can 
      easily detect.

TI  - Using Machine Learning to Derive Just-In-Time and Personalized Predictors of Stress: 
      Observational Study Bridging the Gap Between Nomothetic and Ideographic Approaches.
PG  - e12910
LID - 10.2196/12910 [doi]
LID - e12910
AB  - BACKGROUND: Investigations into person-specific predictors of stress have typically 
      taken either a population-level nomothetic approach or an individualized ideographic 
      approach. Nomothetic approaches can quickly identify predictors but can be hindered 
      by the heterogeneity of these predictors across individuals and time. Ideographic 
      approaches may result in more predictive models at the individual level but require 
      a longer period of data collection to identify robust predictors. OBJECTIVE: Our 
      objectives were to compare predictors of stress identified through nomothetic and 
      ideographic models and to assess whether sequentially combining nomothetic and 
      ideographic models could yield more accurate and actionable predictions of stress 
      than relying on either model. At the same time, we sought to maintain the 
      interpretability necessary to retrieve individual predictors of stress despite using 
      nomothetic models. METHODS: Data collected in a 1-year observational study of 79 
      participants performing low levels of exercise were used. Physical activity was 
      continuously and objectively monitored by actigraphy. Perceived stress was recorded 
      by participants via daily ecological momentary assessments on a mobile app. 
      Environmental variables including daylight time, temperature, and precipitation were 
      retrieved from the public archives. Using these environmental, actigraphy, and 
      mobile assessment data, we built machine learning models to predict individual 
      stress ratings using linear, decision tree, and neural network techniques employing 
      nomothetic and ideographic approaches. The accuracy of the approaches for predicting 
      individual stress ratings was compared based on classification errors. RESULTS: 
      Across the group of patients, an individual's recent history of stress ratings was 
      most heavily weighted in predicting a future stress rating in the nomothetic 
      recurrent neural network model, whereas environmental factors such as temperature 
      and daylight, as well as duration and frequency of bouts of exercise, were more 
      heavily weighted in the ideographic models. The nomothetic recurrent neural network 
      model was the highest performing nomothetic model and yielded 72% accuracy for an 
      80%/20% train/test split. Using the same 80/20 split, the ideographic models yielded 
      75% accuracy. However, restricting ideographic models to participants with more than 
      50 valid days in the training set, with the same 80/20 split, yielded 85% accuracy. 
      CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that for some applications, nomothetic models may be useful 
      for yielding higher initial performance while still surfacing personalized 
      predictors of stress, before switching to ideographic models upon sufficient data 
      collection.

TI  - Actigraphic detection of periodic limb movements: development and validation of a 
      potential device-independent algorithm. A proof of concept study.
LID - zsz117 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/sleep/zsz117 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: We propose a unique device-independent approach to analyze 
      long-term actigraphy signals that can accurately quantify the severity of periodic 
      limb movements in sleep (PLMS). METHODS: We analyzed 6-8 hr of bilateral ankle 
      actigraphy data for 166 consecutively consenting patients who simultaneously 
      underwent routine clinical polysomnography. Using the proposed algorithm, we 
      extracted 14 time and frequency features to identify PLMS. These features were then 
      used to train a Naïve-Bayes learning tool which permitted classification of mild vs. 
      severe PLMS (i.e. periodic limb movements [PLM] index less than vs. greater than 15 
      per hr), as well as classification for four PLM severities (i.e. PLM index < 15, 
      between 15 and 29.9, between 30 and 49.9, and ≥50 movements per hour). RESULTS: 
      Using the proposed signal analysis technique, coupled with a leave-one-out 
      cross-validation method, we obtained a classification accuracy of 89.6%, a 
      sensitivity of 87.9%, and a specificity of 94.1% when classifying a PLM index less 
      than vs. greater than 15 per hr. For the multiclass classification for the four PLM 
      severities, we obtained a classification accuracy of 85.8%, with a sensitivity of 
      97.6%, and a specificity of 84.8%. CONCLUSIONS: Our approach to analyzing long-term 
      actigraphy data provides a method that can be used as a screening tool to detect 
      PLMS using actigraphy devices from various manufacturers and will facilitate 
      detection of PLMS in an ambulatory setting.

TI  - 17q12 Recurrent Deletion Syndrome.
BTI - GeneReviews(®)
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: The 17q12 recurrent deletion syndrome is characterized by 
      variable combinations of the three following findings: structural or functional 
      abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract, maturity-onset diabetes of the young 
      type 5 (MODY5), and neurodevelopmental or neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., 
      developmental delay, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, 
      schizophrenia, anxiety, and bipolar disorder). Using a method of data analysis that 
      avoids ascertainment bias, the authors determined that multicystic kidneys and other 
      structural and functional kidney anomalies occur in 85% to 90% of affected 
      individuals, MODY5 in approximately 40%, and some degree of developmental delay or 
      learning disability in approximately 50%. MODY5 is most often diagnosed before age 
      25 years (range: age 10-50 years). DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis is established 
      in a proband by detection of the 1.4-megabase (Mb) heterozygous recurrent deletion 
      at chromosome 17q12 by chromosomal microarray testing or other genomic methods. 
      MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Treatment of kidney anomalies, 
      neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders, MODY5, genital tract 
      abnormalities, liver abnormalities, eye abnormalities, congenital heart defects, 
      seizures and sensorineural hearing loss should follow standard practice. 
      Surveillance: Kidneys and urinary tract: In the absence of known structural 
      abnormalities, kidney and bladder ultrasound examination 12 months after 
      establishing the diagnosis, then every 2-3 years in childhood/adolescence, then 
      every 3-5 years in adulthood; presence of an abnormality may warrant more frequent 
      monitoring. Annual monitoring of kidney function in individuals with abnormalities 
      detected on kidney ultrasound examination; more frequent monitoring may be advised 
      in those taking potentially nephrotoxic medications and/or known to have impaired 
      kidney function. Routine monitoring of neurodevelopment through early childhood; 
      full neuropsychological evaluation for children who experience difficulty with 
      school. HbA1C annually to monitor for MODY5; self-monitoring by individuals and 
      their families for clinical signs and symptoms of diabetes mellitus, such as 
      polydipsia and polyuria. Consider reevaluation for uterine and vaginal abnormalities 
      related to müllerian duct aplasia in pubertal females with primary amenorrhea. 
      Consider annual hepatic function panel (or comprehensive metabolic panel), GGT, and 
      lipid panel. Annual ophthalmologic evaluation during early childhood. Monitor those 
      with seizures as clinically indicated. Hearing screening throughout childhood. 
      Agents/circumstances to avoid: Because kidney transplantation increases the risk for 
      post-transplant diabetes mellitus, an immunosuppressive regimen that avoids 
      tacrolimus and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors and reduces 
      corticosteroid exposure may benefit those without preexisting diabetes mellitus. 
      Nephrotoxic and hepatotoxic drugs should be avoided by individuals with kidney or 
      liver abnormalities. For individuals with mental health conditions such as autism, 
      schizophrenia, or bipolar disorder, careful consideration of antipsychotic agents 
      that may lead to weight gain is recommended, as this potential increase has been 
      associated with metabolic syndrome and the later development of diabetes mellitus, 
      for which people with 17q12 deletions are at baseline increased risk. Likewise, the 
      use of mood stabilizers that affect kidney function in the long term, such as 
      lithium, should be carefully considered in the setting of potential underlying 
      anatomic and functional abnormalities in people with 17q12 deletions. Evaluation of 
      relatives at risk: If one of the proband's parents has the 17q12 recurrent deletion, 
      it is appropriate to test older and younger sibs of the proband and other relatives 
      at risk in order to identify those who would benefit from close 
      assessment/monitoring for evidence of genitourinary structural or functional 
      defects, MODY5, and developmental delays / intellectual disability. GENETIC 
      COUNSELING: The 17q12 recurrent deletion is inherited in an autosomal dominant 
      manner, with approximately 75% of deletions occurring de novo and approximately 25% 
      inherited from a parent. If the 17q12 recurrent deletion identified in the proband 
      is not found in one of the parents, the risk to sibs is presumed to be lower than 1% 
      (but slightly greater than that of the general population because of the theoretic 
      possibility of parental germline mosaicism for the deletion). Offspring of an 
      individual with the 17q12 recurrent deletion have a 50% chance of inheriting the 
      deletion. Prenatal testing or preimplantation genetic testing using genomic testing 
      that will detect the 17q12 recurrent deletion is possible.

TI  - Emerging Clinical Technology: Application of Machine Learning to Chronic Pain 
      Assessments Based on Emotional Body Maps.
PG  - 774-783
LID - 10.1007/s13311-020-00886-7 [doi]
AB  - Depression and anxiety co-occur with chronic pain, and all three are thought to be 
      caused by dysregulation of shared brain systems related to emotional processing 
      associated with body sensations. Understanding the connection between emotional 
      states, pain, and bodily sensations may help understand chronic pain conditions. We 
      developed a mobile platform for measuring pain, emotions, and associated bodily 
      feelings in chronic pain patients in their daily life conditions. Sixty-five chronic 
      back pain patients reported the intensity of their pain, 11 emotional states, and 
      the corresponding body locations. These variables were used to predict pain 2 weeks 
      later. Applying machine learning, we developed two predictive models of future pain, 
      emphasizing interpretability. One model excluded pain-related features as predictors 
      of future pain, and the other included pain-related predictors. The best predictors 
      of future pain were interactive effects of (a) body maps of fatigue with negative 
      affect and (b) positive affect with past pain. Our findings emphasize the 
      contribution of emotions, especially emotional experience felt in the body, to 
      understanding chronic pain above and beyond the mere tracking of pain levels. The 
      results may contribute to the generation of a novel artificial intelligence 
      framework to help in the development of better diagnostic and therapeutic approaches 
      to chronic pain.

      High-Risk ASD: The Role of Mother-Child Dyadic Synchrony.
PG  - 581893
LID - 10.3389/fped.2020.581893 [doi]
LID - 581893
AB  - Background: Interindividual variability is important in the evolution of adaptative 
      profiles of children with ASD having benefited from an early intervention make up 
      for deficits in communication, language and social interactions. Therefore, this 
      paper aimed to determine the nature of factors influencing the efficacy variability 
      of a particular intervention technique i.e., "Play-based communication and behavior 
      intervention" (PCBI). Methods: The participants comprised 70 13-30-month-old 
      toddlers with ASD enrolled in PCBI for 12 weeks. The Autism Treatment Evaluation 
      Checklist (ATEC) was used to evaluate the efficacy of PCBI. Video recordings of 5 
      min of free-play before and after PCBI were used to examine behaviors of mothers and 
      children and parent-child dyadic synchrony. Hierarchical multiple regression 
      analyses and machine learning algorithms were performed to explore the effect of 
      these potential predictors (mothers' factors, children's factors and videotaped 
      mother-child interaction) of intervention efficacy. Results: The hierarchical 
      regression analysis and the machine learning algorithms indicated that parenting 
      stress, level of completion of training at home and mother-child dyadic synchrony 
      were crucial factors in predicting and monitoring the efficacy of PCBI. Conclusions: 
      In summary, the findings suggest that PCBI could be particularly beneficial to 
      children with ASD who show a good performance in the mother-child dyadic synchrony 
      evaluation. A better dyadic mother-child synchrony could enhance the PCBI efficacy 
      through adapted emotional and behavioral responses of the mother and the child and 
      has a beneficial influence on the child's psychological development.

      Monitoring.
PG  - 285-292
LID - 10.4258/hir.2017.23.4.285 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Stress management is related to public healthcare and quality of life; 
      an accurate stress classification method is necessary for the design of stress 
      monitoring systems. Therefore, the goal of this study was to design a novel stress 
      classification model using a deep learning method. METHODS: In this paper, we 
      present a stress classification model using the dataset from the sixth Korea 
      National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey conducted from 2013 to 2015 
      (KNHANES VI) to analyze stress-related health data. Statistical analysis was 
      performed to identify the nine features of stress detection, and we evaluated the 
      performance of the proposed stress classification by comparison with several stress 
      detection models. The proposed model was also evaluated using Deep Belief Networks 
      (DBN). RESULTS: We designed profiles depending on the number of hidden layers, 
      nodes, and hyper-parameters according to the loss function results. The experimental 
      results showed that the proposed model achieved an accuracy and a specificity of 
      66.23% and 75.32%, respectively. The proposed DBN model performed better than other 
      classification models, such as support vector machine, naive Bayesian classifier, 
      and random forest. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed model in this study was demonstrated to 
      be effective in classifying stress detection, and in particular, it is expected to 
      be applicable for stress prediction in stress monitoring systems.

AB  - Couple HIV counseling and testing (CHCT) is key in preventing heterosexual HIV 
      transmission and achievement of 90-90-90 UNAIDS treatment targets by 2020. We 
      conducted secondary data analysis to assess utilization of CHCT and associated 
      factors using logistic regression. 58/134 participants (49%) had ever utilized CHCT. 
      Disclosure of individual HIV results to a partner [aOR = 16; 95% CI: (3.6-67)], 
      residence for > 1 < 5 years [aOR = 0.04; 95% CI (0.005-0.33)], and none mobility 
      [aOR = 3.6; 95% CI (1.1-12)] were significantly associated with CHCT. Age modified 
      relationship between CHCT and disclosure (Likelihood-ratio test LR chi2 = 4.2 (p 
      value = 0.041). Disclosure of individual HIV results with a partner and residence 
      for more than 1 year improved utilization of CHCT; mobility reduced the odds of 
      CHCT. Interventions should target prior discussion of individual HIV results among 
      couples and mobile populations to increase CHCT.

TI  - Technical workflows for hyperspectral plant image assessment and processing on the 
      greenhouse and laboratory scale.
LID - 10.1093/gigascience/giaa090 [doi]
LID - giaa090
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of hyperspectral cameras is well established in the field of 
      plant phenotyping, especially as a part of high-throughput routines in greenhouses. 
      Nevertheless, the workflows used differ depending on the applied camera, the plants 
      being imaged, the experience of the users, and the measurement set-up. RESULTS: This 
      review describes a general workflow for the assessment and processing of 
      hyperspectral plant data at greenhouse and laboratory scale. Aiming at a detailed 
      description of possible error sources, a comprehensive literature review of 
      possibilities to overcome these errors and influences is provided. The processing of 
      hyperspectral data of plants starting from the hardware sensor calibration, the 
      software processing steps to overcome sensor inaccuracies, and the preparation for 
      machine learning is shown and described in detail. Furthermore, plant traits 
      extracted from spectral hypercubes are categorized to standardize the terms used 
      when describing hyperspectral traits in plant phenotyping. A scientific data 
      perspective is introduced covering information for canopy, single organs, plant 
      development, and also combined traits coming from spectral and 3D measuring devices. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This publication provides a structured overview on implementing 
      hyperspectral imaging into biological studies at greenhouse and laboratory scale. 
      Workflows have been categorized to define a trait-level scale according to their 
      metrological level and the processing complexity. A general workflow is shown to 
      outline procedures and requirements to provide fully calibrated data of the highest 
      quality. This is essential for differentiation of the smallest changes from 
      hyperspectral reflectance of plants, to track and trace hyperspectral development as 
      an answer to biotic or abiotic stresses.

AB  - Monitoring the sleep patterns of children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and 
      understanding how sleep quality influences their daytime behavior is an important 
      issue that has received very limited attention. Polysomnography (PSG) is commonly 
      used as a gold standard for evaluating sleep quality in children and adults. 
      However, the intrusive nature of sensors used as part of PSG can themselves affect 
      sleep and is, therefore, not suitable for children with ASD. In this study, we 
      evaluate an unobtrusive and inexpensive bed system for in-home, long-term sleep 
      quality monitoring using ballistocardiogram (BCG) signals. Using the BCG signals 
      from this smart bed system, we define "restlessness" as a surrogate sleep quality 
      estimator. Using this sleep feature, we build predictive models for daytime behavior 
      based on 1-8 previous nights of sleep. Specifically, we use two supervised machine 
      learning algorithms namely support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural 
      network (ANN). For all daytime behaviors, we achieve more than 78% and 79% accuracy 
      of correctly predicting behavioral issues with both SVM and ANN classifiers, 
      respectively. Our findings indicate the usefulness of our designed bed system and 
      how the restlessness feature can improve the prediction performance.

TI  - Prison primary care and non-communicable diseases: a data-linkage survey of 
      prevalence and associated risk factors.

LID - 10.3399/bjgpopen19X101643 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The size and mean age of the prison population has increased rapidly in 
      recent years. Prisoners are a vulnerable group who, compared with the general 
      population, experience poorer health outcomes. However, there is a dearth of 
      research quantifying the prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) among 
      prisoner populations. AIM: To explore both the prevalence of NCDs and their risk 
      factors. DESIGN & SETTING: A cross-sectional survey was undertaken that was compared 
      with clinical records in two male prisons in the north of England. METHOD: 
      Self-report surveys were completed by 199 prisoners to assess sociodemographic 
      characteristics, general health, NCD prevalence, and risk factor prevalence. Data 
      were checked against that retrieved from prison clinical records. RESULTS: It was 
      found that 46% reported at least one NCD and 26% reported at least one physical 
      health NCD. The most common self-reported NCD was 'anxiety and depression' (34%), 
      followed by 'respiratory disease' (17%), and 'hypertension' (10%). Having a physical 
      health NCD was independently associated with increasing age or drug dependence.The 
      level of agreement between clinical records and self-report ranged from 'fair' for 
      alcohol dependence (kappa 0.38; P<0.001) to 'very good' for diabetes (kappa 0.86; 
      P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Compared with mainstream populations and despite high 
      prevalence of risk factors for NCDs physical illness NCDs, with the exception of 
      respiratory disease, are less common. However, poor mental health is more common. 
      These differences are possibly owing to the younger average age of prison 
      populations, since prevalence of risk factors was reported as high.Secondary data 
      analysis of clinical records is a more methodologically robust way of monitoring 
      trends in prisoner population disease prevalence.

TI  - Understanding visual attention to face emotions in social anxiety using hidden 
      Markov models.
PG  - 1704-1710
LID - 10.1080/02699931.2020.1781599 [doi]
AB  - Theoretical models propose that attentional biases might account for the maintenance 
      of social anxiety symptoms. However, previous eye-tracking studies have yielded 
      mixed results. One explanation is that existing studies quantify eye-movements using 
      arbitrary, experimenter-defined criteria such as time segments and regions of 
      interests that do not capture the dynamic nature of overt visual attention. The 
      current study adopted the Eye Movement analysis with Hidden Markov Models (EMHMM) 
      approach for eye-movement analysis, a machine-learning, data-driven approach that 
      can cluster people's eye-movements into different strategy groups. Sixty 
      participants high and low in self-reported social anxiety symptoms viewed angry and 
      neutral faces in a free-viewing task while their eye-movements were recorded. EMHMM 
      analyses revealed novel associations between eye-movement patterns and social 
      anxiety symptoms that were not evident with standard analytical approaches. 
      Participants who adopted the same face-viewing strategy when viewing both angry and 
      neutral faces showed higher social anxiety symptoms than those who transitioned 
      between strategies when viewing angry versus neutral faces. EMHMM can offer novel 
      insights into psychopathology-related attention processes.

TI  - Plant TDP1 (Tyrosyl-DNA Phosphodiesterase 1): A Phylogenetic Perspective and Gene 
      Expression Data Mining.
LID - 10.3390/genes11121465 [doi]
LID - 1465
AB  - The TDP1 (tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1) enzyme removes the non-specific covalent 
      intermediates between topoisomerase I and DNA, thus playing a crucial role in 
      preventing DNA damage. While mammals possess only one TDP1 gene, in plants two genes 
      (TDP1α and TDP1β) are present constituting a small gene subfamily. These display a 
      different domain structure and appear to perform non-overlapping functions in the 
      maintenance of genome integrity. Namely, the HIRAN domain identified in TDP1β is 
      involved in the interaction with DNA during the recognition of stalled replication 
      forks. The availability of transcriptomic databases in a growing variety of 
      experimental systems provides new opportunities to fill the current gaps of 
      knowledge concerning the evolutionary origin and the specialized roles of TDP1 genes 
      in plants. Whereas a phylogenetic approach has been used to track the evolution of 
      plant TDP1 protein, transcriptomic data from a selection of representative 
      lycophyte, eudicots, and monocots have been implemented to explore the 
      transcriptomic dynamics in different tissues and a variety of biotic and abiotic 
      stress conditions. While the phylogenetic analysis indicates that TDP1α is of 
      non-plant origin and TDP1β is plant-specific originating in ancient vascular plants, 
      the gene expression data mining comparative analysis pinpoints for tissue- and 
      stress-specific responses.

TI  - DNA Fiber Assay for the Analysis of DNA Replication Progression in Human Pluripotent 
      Stem Cells.
PG  - e115
LID - 10.1002/cpsc.115 [doi]
AB  - Human pluripotent stem cells (PSC) acquire recurrent chromosomal instabilities 
      during prolonged in vitro culture that threaten to preclude their use in cell-based 
      regenerative medicine. The rapid proliferation of pluripotent cells leads to 
      constitutive replication stress, hindering the progression of DNA replication forks 
      and in some cases leading to replication-fork collapse. Failure to overcome 
      replication stress can result in incomplete genome duplication, which, if left to 
      persist into the subsequent mitosis, can result in structural and numerical 
      chromosomal instability. We have recently applied the DNA fiber assay to the study 
      of replication stress in human PSC and found that, in comparison to somatic cells 
      states, these cells display features of DNA replication stress that include slower 
      replication fork speeds, evidence of stalled forks, and replication initiation from 
      dormant replication origins. These findings have expanded on previous work 
      demonstrating that extensive DNA damage in human PSC is replication associated. In 
      this capacity, the DNA fiber assay has enabled the development of an advanced 
      nucleoside-enriched culture medium that increases replication fork progression and 
      decreases DNA damage and mitotic errors in human PSC cultures. The DNA fiber assay 
      allows for the study of replication fork dynamics at single-molecule resolution. The 
      assay relies on cells incorporating nucleotide analogs into nascent DNA during 
      replication, which are then measured to monitor several replication parameters. Here 
      we provide an optimized protocol for the fiber assay intended for use with human 
      PSC, and describe the methods employed to analyze replication fork parameters. ©

TI  - Short-term prediction of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in adolescents: Can recent 
      developments in technology and computational science provide a breakthrough?

AB  - BACKGROUND: Suicide is one of the leading causes of death among adolescents, and 
      developing effective methods to improve short-term prediction of suicidal thoughts 
      and behaviors (STBs) is critical. Currently, the most robust predictors of STBs are 
      demographic or clinical indicators that have relatively weak predictive value. 
      However, there is an emerging literature on short-term prediction of suicide risk 
      that has identified a number of promising candidates, including (but not limited to) 
      rapid escalation of: (a) emotional distress, (b) social dysfunction (e.g., bullying, 
      rejection), and (c) sleep disturbance. However, these prior studies are limited in 
      two critical ways. First, they rely almost entirely on self-report. Second, most 
      studies have not focused on assessment of these risk factors using intensive 
      longitudinal assessment techniques that are able to capture the dynamics of changes 
      in risk states at the individual level. METHOD: In this paper we explore how to 
      capitalize on recent developments in real-time monitoring methods and computational 
      analysis in order to address these fundamental problems. RESULTS: We now have the 
      capacity to use: (a) smartphone, wearable computing, and smart home technology to 
      conduct intensive longitudinal assessments monitoring of putative risk factors with 
      minimal participant burden and (b) modern computational techniques to develop 
      predictive algorithms for STBs. Current research and theory on short-term risk 
      processes for STBs, combined with the emergent capabilities of new technologies, 
      suggest that this is an important research agenda for the future. LIMITATIONS: 
      Although these approaches have enormous potential to create new knowledge, the 
      current empirical literature is limited. Moreover, passive monitoring of risk for 
      STBs raises complex ethical issues that will need to be resolved before large scale 
      clinical applications are feasible. CONCLUSIONS: Smartphone, wearable, and smart 
      home technology may provide one point of access that might facilitate both early 
      identification and intervention implementation, and thus, represents a key area for

TI  - Identifying and validating blood mRNA biomarkers for acute and chronic insufficient 
      sleep in humans: a machine learning approach.
LID - 10.1093/sleep/zsy186 [doi]
LID - zsy186
AB  - Acute and chronic insufficient sleep are associated with adverse health outcomes and 
      risk of accidents. There is therefore a need for biomarkers to monitor sleep debt 
      status. None are currently available. We applied elastic net and ridge regression to 
      transcriptome samples collected in 36 healthy young adults during acute total sleep 
      deprivation and following 1 week of either chronic insufficient (<6 hr) or 
      sufficient sleep (~8.6 hr) to identify panels of mRNA biomarkers of sleep debt 
      status. The size of identified panels ranged from 9 to 74 biomarkers. Panel 
      performance, assessed by leave-one-subject-out cross-validation and independent 
      validation, varied between sleep debt conditions. Using between-subject assessments 
      based on one blood sample, the accuracy of classifying "acute sleep loss" was 92%, 
      but only 57% for classifying "chronic sleep insufficiency." A reasonable accuracy 
      for classifying "chronic sleep insufficiency" could only be achieved by a 
      within-subject comparison of blood samples. Biomarkers for sleep debt status showed 
      little overlap with previously identified biomarkers for circadian phase. Biomarkers 
      for acute and chronic sleep loss also showed little overlap but were associated with 
      common functions related to the cellular stress response, such as heat shock protein 
      activity, the unfolded protein response, protein ubiquitination and endoplasmic 
      reticulum-associated protein degradation, and apoptosis. This characteristic 
      response of whole blood to sleep loss can further aid our understanding of how sleep 
      insufficiencies negatively affect health. Further development of these novel 
      biomarkers for research and clinical practice requires validation in other protocols 
      and age groups.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The patellofemoral (PF) joint is a common site for non-specific anterior 
      knee pain. The pathophysiology of patellofemoral pain may be related to abnormal 
      motion of the patella relative to the femur, leading to increased stress at the 
      patellofemoral joint. Patellofemoral motion cannot be accurately measured using 
      conventional motion capture. RESEARCH QUESTION: The aim of this study was to 
      determine the accuracy of a biplane radiography system for measuring in vivo PF 
      motion during walking and stair ascent. METHODS: Four subjects had three 1.0 mm 
      diameter tantalum beads implanted into the patella. Participants performed three 
      trials each of over ground walking and stair ascent while biplane radiographs were 
      collected at 100 Hz. Patella motion was tracked using radiostereophotogrammetric 
      analysis (RSA) as a "gold standard", and compared to a volumetric CT model-based 
      tracking algorithm that matched digitally reconstructed radiographs to the original 
      biplane radiographs. RESULTS: The average RMS difference between the RSA and 
      model-based tracking was 0.41 mm and 1.97° when there was no obstruction from the 
      contralateral leg. These differences increased by 34% and 40%, respectively, when 
      the patella was at least partially obstructed by the contralateral leg. The average 
      RMS difference in patellofemoral joint space between tracking methods was 0.9 mm or 
      less. SIGNIFICANCE: Previous validations of biplane radiographic systems have 
      estimated tracking accuracy by moving cadaveric knees through simulated motions. 
      These validations were unable to replicate in vivo kinematics, including patella 
      motion due to muscle activation, and failed to assess the imaging and tracking 
      challenges related to contralateral limb obstruction. By replicating the muscle 
      contraction, movement velocity, joint range of motion, and obstruction of the 
      patella by the contralateral limb, the present study provides a realistic estimate 
      of patellofemoral tracking accuracy for future in vivo studies.

TI  - Are our babies off to a healthy start? The state of implementation of the Global 
      strategy for infant and young child feeding in Europe.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To protect children's right to optimal nutrition, WHO/UNICEF developed a 
      Global Strategy for Infant and Young Child Feeding, endorsed by all 53 WHO/EURO 
      Member States. The World Breastfeeding Trends Initiative (WBTi) is a tool for 
      monitoring implementation of the Global Strategy. It comprises 15 indicators, ten 
      referring to policies and programmes, and five to feeding practices. Each is scored 
      on a scale of 10, giving a total score of 150 for Global Strategy implementation. To 
      date, 18 WHO/EURO Member States - Armenia, Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, 
      Croatia, France, Georgia, Germany, Italy, Lithuania, North Macedonia, Malta, 
      Moldova, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, Ukraine and United Kingdom - have conducted a WBTi 
      assessment and produced a report. METHODS: Between June 2018 and May 2019, all 18 
      WBTi European reports were carefully read and analysed by a group of national WBTi 
      coordinators. Descriptive data analysis, including inter-country comparisons, was 
      conducted using frequencies and percentages. This paper summarises the findings. The 
      full 88-page report will be published on the WBTi website. RESULTS: Three-quarters 
      of 18 European countries have adequate maternity protection, and two-thirds have 
      breastfeeding initiation rates of 50% or higher. However, 'Preparedness and planning 
      for appropriate and safe Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) in emergencies' is 
      seriously neglected. Breastfeeding duration is far below WHO recommendations, with 
      an average of 8.7 months. Only three European countries have a budget allocated for 
      implementing IYCF policies and plans, and a third currently have no Baby-friendly 
      designated maternity facilities. Bottle feeding is prevalent, despite its inherent 
      risks, monitoring of IYCF practices is inadequate, with most countries not routinely 
      collecting data, and violations of the International Code of Marketing of 
      Breast-milk Substitutes are commonplace. CONCLUSIONS: European governments are not 
      doing enough to protect, promote and support sound infant and young child feeding 
      practices. Political commitment at the highest level and adequate funding are 
      required to ensure optimal IYCF for Europe's babies. This report highlights worrying 
      gaps, thereby providing governments, international organisations and other concerned 
      parties with an opportunity to invest in priority areas and, by doing so, hopefully 
      create a better future for our babies.

TI  - Predicting Future Perceived Wellness in Professional Soccer: The Role of Preceding 
      Load and Wellness.
PG  - 1074-1080
LID - ijspp.2017-0864 [pii]
LID - 10.1123/ijspp.2017-0864 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The influence of preceding load and future perceived wellness of 
      professional soccer players is unexamined. This paper simultaneously evaluates the 
      external load (EL) and internal load (IL) for different time frames in combination 
      with presession wellness to predict future perceived wellness using machine learning 
      techniques. METHODS: Training and match data were collected from a professional 
      soccer team. The EL was measured using global positioning system technology and 
      accelerometry. The IL was obtained using the rating of perceived exertion multiplied 
      by duration. Predictive models were constructed using gradient-boosted regression 
      trees (GBRT) and one naive baseline method. The individual predictions of future 
      wellness items (ie, fatigue, sleep quality, general muscle soreness, stress levels, 
      and mood) were based on a set of EL and IL indicators in combination with presession 
      wellness. The EL and IL were computed for acute and cumulative time frames. The GBRT 
      model's performance on predicting the reported future wellness was compared with the 
      naive baseline's performance by means of absolute prediction error and effect size. 
      RESULTS: The GBRT model outperformed the baseline for the wellness items such as 
      fatigue, general muscle soreness, stress levels, and mood. In addition, only the 
      combination of EL, IL, and presession perceived wellness resulted in nontrivial 
      effects for predicting future wellness. Including the cumulative load did not 
      improve the predictive performances. CONCLUSIONS: The findings may indicate the 
      importance of including both acute load and presession perceived wellness in a broad 
      monitoring approach in professional soccer.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the added predictive value of combining clinical 
      information and myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography 
      (SPECT) imaging (MPI) data using machine learning (ML) to predict major adverse 
      cardiac events (MACE). BACKGROUND: Traditionally, prognostication by MPI has relied 
      on visual or quantitative analysis of images without objective consideration of the 
      clinical data. ML permits a large number of variables to be considered in 
      combination and at a level of complexity beyond the human clinical reader. METHODS: 
      A total of 2,619 consecutive patients (48% men; 62 ± 13 years of age) who underwent 
      exercise (38%) or pharmacological stress (62%) with high-speed SPECT MPI were 
      monitored for MACE. Twenty-eight clinical variables, 17 stress test variables, and 
      25 imaging variables (including total perfusion deficit [TPD]) were recorded. Areas 
      under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) for MACE prediction were 
      compared among: 1) ML with all available data (ML-combined); 2) ML with only imaging 
      data (ML-imaging); 3) 5-point scale visual diagnosis (physician [MD] diagnosis); and 
      4) automated quantitative imaging analysis (stress TPD and ischemic TPD). ML 
      involved automated variable selection by information gain ranking, model building 
      with a boosted ensemble algorithm, and 10-fold stratified cross validation. RESULTS: 
      During follow-up (3.2 ± 0.6 years), 239 patients (9.1%) had MACE. MACE prediction 
      was significantly higher for ML-combined than ML-imaging (AUC: 0.81 vs. 0.78; p < 
      0.01). ML-combined also had higher predictive accuracy compared with MD diagnosis, 
      automated stress TPD, and automated ischemic TPD (AUC: 0.81 vs. 0.65 vs. 0.73 vs. 
      0.71, respectively; p < 0.01 for all). Risk reclassification for ML-combined 
      compared with visual MD diagnosis was 26% (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: ML combined with 
      both clinical and imaging data variables was found to have high predictive 
      accuracy for 3-year risk of MACE and was superior to existing visual or automated 
      perfusion assessments. ML could allow integration of clinical and imaging data for 
      personalized MACE risk computations in patients undergoing SPECT MPI.

TI  - The accuracy of passive phone sensors in predicting daily mood.
PG  - 72-81
LID - 10.1002/da.22822 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Smartphones provide a low-cost and efficient means to collect population 
      level data. Several small studies have shown promise in predicting mood variability 
      from smartphone-based sensor and usage data, but have not been generalized to 
      nationally recruited samples. This study used passive smartphone data, demographic 
      characteristics, and baseline depressive symptoms to predict prospective daily mood. 
      METHOD: Daily phone usage data were collected passively from 271 Android phone users 
      participating in a fully remote randomized controlled trial of depression treatment 
      (BRIGHTEN). Participants completed daily Patient Health Questionnaire-2. A machine 
      learning approach was used to predict daily mood for the entire sample and 
      individual participants. RESULTS: Sample-wide estimates showed a marginally 
      significant association between physical mobility and self-reported daily mood 
      (B = -0.04, P < 0.05), but the predictive models performed poorly for the sample as 
      a whole (median R(2) ∼ 0). Focusing on individuals, 13.9% of participants showed 
      significant association (FDR < 0.10) between a passive feature and daily mood. 
      Personalized models combining features provided better prediction performance 
      (median area under the curve [AUC] > 0.50) for 80.6% of participants and very strong 
      prediction in a subset (median AUC > 0.80) for 11.8% of participants. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Passive smartphone data with current features may not be suited for predicting daily 
      mood at a population level because of the high degree of intra- and interindividual 
      variation in phone usage patterns and daily mood ratings. Personalized models show 
      encouraging early signs for predicting an individual's mood state changes, with 
      GPS-derived mobility being the top most important feature in the present sample.

TI  - AHCODA-DB: a data repository with web-based mining tools for the analysis of 
      automated high-content mouse phenomics data.

LID - 200
AB  - BACKGROUND: Systematic, standardized and in-depth phenotyping and data analyses of 
      rodent behaviour empowers gene-function studies, drug testing and therapy design. 
      However, no data repositories are currently available for standardized quality 
      control, data analysis and mining at the resolution of individual mice. DESCRIPTION: 
      Here, we present AHCODA-DB, a public data repository with standardized quality 
      control and exclusion criteria aimed to enhance robustness of data, enabled with 
      web-based mining tools for the analysis of individually and group-wise collected 
      mouse phenotypic data. AHCODA-DB allows monitoring in vivo effects of compounds 
      collected from conventional behavioural tests and from automated home-cage 
      experiments assessing spontaneous behaviour, anxiety and cognition without human 
      interference. AHCODA-DB includes such data from mutant mice (transgenics, knock-out, 
      knock-in), (recombinant) inbred strains, and compound effects in wildtype mice and 
      disease models. AHCODA-DB provides real time statistical analyses with single mouse 
      resolution and versatile suite of data presentation tools. On March 9th, 2017 
      AHCODA-DB contained 650 k data points on 2419 parameters from 1563 mice. CONCLUSION: 
      AHCODA-DB provides users with tools to systematically explore mouse behavioural 
      data, both with positive and negative outcome, published and unpublished, across 
      time and experiments with single mouse resolution. The standardized (automated) 
      experimental settings and the large current dataset (1563 mice) in AHCODA-DB provide 
      a unique framework for the interpretation of behavioural data and drug effects. The 
      use of common ontologies allows data export to other databases such as the Mouse 
      Phenome Database. Unbiased presentation of positive and negative data obtained under 
      the highly standardized screening conditions increase cost efficiency of publicly 
      funded mouse screening projects and help to reach consensus conclusions on drug 
      responses and mouse behavioural phenotypes. The website is publicly accessible 
      through https://public.sylics.com and can be viewed in every recent version of all 
      commonly used browsers.

TI  - Awareness and bispectral index (BIS) monitoring in mechanically ventilated patients 
      in the emergency department and intensive care unit: a systematic review protocol.
PG  - e034673
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2019-034673 [doi]
LID - e034673
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Accidental awareness with recall is one of the most feared 
      complications for patients undergoing general anaesthesia and can lead to 
      post-traumatic stress disorder in up to 70% of patients experiencing it. To reduce 
      the incidence of awareness with recall, the bispectral index monitor is recommended 
      for patients receiving total intravenous anaesthetics, especially those receiving 
      neuromuscular blockers. While extensive investigation into awareness and bispectral 
      index monitoring has occurred for operating room patients, this has not extended to 
      other clinical arenas where sedated and mechanically ventilated patients are cared 
      for, namely the intensive care unit and emergency department. The purpose of this 
      systematic review is to assess the world's literature to determine the incidence of 
      awareness with paralysis in mechanically ventilated patients and the impact of 
      bispectral index monitoring for reducing this complication. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: 
      Randomised trials and non-randomised studies are eligible for inclusion. With aid 
      from a medical librarian, an electronic search will include Ovid Medline, 
      Embase.com, Scopus, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Cochrane Central 
      Register of Controlled Trials. To find data published in abstract form, literature 
      from professional society conferences (2010-2019) will be manually searched. Two 
      authors will independently review search results and consensus will be reached with 
      assistance from a third author, as needed. Heterogeneity and publication bias will 
      be assessed and reported. If possible and appropriate, a meta-analysis of the data 
      will be conducted for quantitative data analysis. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The 
      proposed systematic review does not require ethical approval, as it is conducted at 
      the study level and does not involve individual patient-level data. Results will be 
      disseminated by data sharing via academically established means, presentation at 
      local and national scientific meetings and publication as a peer-reviewed 
      manuscript. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: The protocol has been submitted to 
      International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews and is awaiting 
      registration.

AB  - The importance of quinoa has been emphasized considerably in the recent decades, as 
      a highly nutritional crop seed that is tolerant to salinity and amenable to arid 
      agronomical conditions. The focus of this paper is to provide raw and a supplemental 
      data of the research article entitled "Agronomic performance of irrigated quinoa in 
      desert areas: comparing different approaches for early assessment of salinity 
      stress" [1], aiming to compare different approaches for early detection, at the 
      genotypic and crop levels, of the effect of salinity caused by irrigation on the 
      agronomic performance of this crop. A set of 20 genotypes was grown under drip 
      irrigation in sandy soil, amended with manure, at the International Center for 
      Biosaline Agriculture (UAE) for two weeks, after which half of the trial was 
      submitted to irrigation with saline water and this was continued until crop 
      maturity. After eight weeks of applying the two irrigation regimes, pigment contents 
      were evaluated in fully expanded leaves. The same leaves were then harvested, dried 
      and the stable carbon and nitrogen isotope compositions (δ(13)C and δ(15)N) and the 
      total nitrogen and carbon contents of the dry matter analyzed, together with ion 
      concentrations. At maturity yield components were assessed and yield harvested. Data 
      analysis demonstrated significant differences in genotypes response under each 
      treatment, within all assessed parameters. The significant level was provided using 
      the Tukey-b test on independent samples. The present dataset highlights the 
      potential use of different approaches to crop phenotyping and monitoring decision 
      making.

AB  - The tissue-specific etiology of aging and stress has been elusive due to limitations 
      in data processing of current techniques. Despite that many techniques are 
      high-throughput, they usually use singular features of the data (e.g. whole 
      fluorescence). One technology at the nexus of fluorescence-based screens is large 
      particle flow cytometry ("biosorter"), capable of recording positional fluorescence 
      and object granularity information from many individual live animals. Current 
      processing of biosorter data, however, do not integrate positional information into 
      their analysis and data visualization. Here, we present a bioanalytical platform for 
      the quantification of positional information ("longitudinal profiling") of C. 
      elegans, which we posit embodies the benefits of both high-throughput screening and 
      high-resolution microscopy. We show the use of these techniques in (1) 
      characterizing distinct responses of a transcriptional reporter to various stresses 
      in defined anatomical regions, (2) identifying regions of high mitochondrial 
      membrane potential in live animals, (3) monitoring regional mitochondrial activity 
      in aging models and during development, and (4) screening for regulators of muscle 
      mitochondrial dynamics in a high-throughput format. This platform offers a 
      significant improvement in the quality of high-throughput biosorter data analysis 
      and visualization, opening new options for region-specific phenotypic screening of 
      complex physiological phenomena and mitochondrial biology.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence-Powered Smartphone App to Facilitate Medication Adherence: 
      Protocol for a Human Factors Design Study.
PG  - e21659
LID - 10.2196/21659 [doi]
LID - e21659
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medication Guides consisting of crucial interactions and side effects 
      are extensive and complex. Due to the exhaustive information, patients do not retain 
      the necessary medication information, which can result in hospitalizations and 
      medication nonadherence. A gap exists in understanding patients' cognition of 
      managing complex medication information. However, advancements in technology and 
      artificial intelligence (AI) allow us to understand patient cognitive processes to 
      design an app to better provide important medication information to patients. 
      OBJECTIVE: Our objective is to improve the design of an innovative AI- and human 
      factor-based interface that supports patients' medication information comprehension 
      that could potentially improve medication adherence. METHODS: This study has three 
      aims. Aim 1 has three phases: (1) an observational study to understand patient 
      perception of fear and biases regarding medication information, (2) an eye-tracking 
      study to understand the attention locus for medication information, and (3) a 
      psychological refractory period (PRP) paradigm study to understand functionalities. 
      Observational data will be collected, such as audio and video recordings, gaze 
      mapping, and time from PRP. A total of 50 patients, aged 18-65 years, who started at 
      least one new medication, for which we developed visualization information, and who 
      have a cognitive status of 34 during cognitive screening using the TICS-M test and 
      health literacy level will be included in this aim of the study. In Aim 2, we will 
      iteratively design and evaluate an AI-powered medication information visualization 
      interface as a smartphone app with the knowledge gained from each component of Aim 
      1. The interface will be assessed through two usability surveys. A total of 300 
      patients, aged 18-65 years, with diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, or mental health 
      disorders, will be recruited for the surveys. Data from the surveys will be analyzed 
      through exploratory factor analysis. In Aim 3, in order to test the prototype, there 
      will be a two-arm study design. This aim will include 900 patients, aged 18-65 
      years, with internet access, without any cognitive impairment, and with at least two 
      medications. Patients will be sequentially randomized. Three surveys will be used to 
      assess the primary outcome of medication information comprehension and the secondary 
      outcome of medication adherence at 12 weeks. RESULTS: Preliminary data collection 
      will be conducted in 2021, and results are expected to be published in 2022. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study will lead the future of AI-based, innovative, digital 
      interface design and aid in improving medication comprehension, which may improve 
      medication adherence. The results from this study will also open up future research 
      opportunities in understanding how patients manage complex medication information 
      and will inform the format and design for innovative, AI-powered digital interfaces 
      for Medication Guides. INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID):

TI  - An approach to monitoring home-cage behavior in mice that facilitates data sharing.
PG  - 1331-1347
LID - 10.1038/nprot.2018.031 [doi]
AB  - Genetically modified mice are used as models for a variety of human behavioral 
      conditions. However, behavioral phenotyping can be a major bottleneck in mouse 
      genetics because many of the classic protocols are too long and/or are vulnerable to 
      unaccountable sources of variance, leading to inconsistent results between centers. 
      We developed a home-cage approach using a Chora feeder that is controlled by-and 
      sends data to-software. In this approach, mice are tested in the standard cages in 
      which they are held for husbandry, which removes confounding variables such as the 
      stress induced by out-of-cage testing. This system increases the throughput of data 
      gathering from individual animals and facilitates data mining by offering new 
      opportunities for multimodal data comparisons. In this protocol, we use a simple 
      work-for-food testing strategy as an example application, but the approach can be 
      adapted for other experiments looking at, e.g., attention, decision-making or 
      memory. The spontaneous behavioral activity of mice in performing the behavioral 
      task can be monitored 24 h a day for several days, providing an integrated 
      assessment of the circadian profiles of different behaviors. We developed a 
      Python-based open-source analytical platform (Phenopy) that is accessible to 
      scientists with no programming background and can be used to design and control such 
      experiments, as well as to collect and share data. This approach is suitable for 
      large-scale studies involving multiple laboratories.

TI  - Portal vein innervation underlying the pressor effect of water ingestion with and 
      without cold stress.
PG  - 53-59
LID - 10.4103/CJP.CJP_96_19 [doi]
AB  - Water-induced pressor response appears mediated through the activation of transient 
      receptor potential channel TRPV4 on hepatic portal circulation in animals. We sought 
      to elucidate the mechanism of portal vein signaling in this response. Forty-five 
      rats were divided into four groups: control rats without water ingestion (WI), 
      control rats with WI, portal vein denervation rats with WI (PVDWI), and TRPV4 
      antagonist-treated rats with WI (anti-TRPV4WI). Cardiovascular responses were 
      monitored throughout the experiments. Data analysis was performed using descriptive 
      methods and spectral and cross-spectral analysis of blood pressure variability (BPV) 
      and heart rate variability (HRV). Key results showed that at baseline (PreCS) before 
      cold stress trial (CS), WI elicited robust pressor and tachycardia responses 
      accompanied by spectral power changes, in particular, increases of low-frequency BPV 
      (LFBPV) and very-LFBPV (VLFBPV), but decrease of very-low-frequency HRV. PVDWI, 
      likewise, elicited pressor and tachycardia responses accompanied by increases of 
      high-frequency BPV, high-frequency HRV, LFBPV, low-frequency HRV, and VLFBPV. When 
      compared with WI at PreCS, WI at CS elicited pressor and tachycardia responses 
      accompanied by increases of high-frequency BPV, LFBPV, and VLFBPV, whereas in WI, 
      the CS-evoked pressor response and the accompanied LFBPV and VLFBPV increases were 
      all tended augmented by PVDWI. When compared with WI and PVDWI at both PreCS and CS, 
      however, anti-TRPV4WI attenuated their pressor responses and attenuated their 
      increased LFBPV, VLFBPV, and very-low-frequency HRV. The results indicate that the 
      portal vein innervation is critical for a buffering mechanism in splanchnic 
      sympathetic activation and water-induced pressor response.

TI  - Music to improve sleep quality in adults with depression-related insomnia (MUSTAFI): 
      study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Insomnia is a common sleep disorder for adults with depression, with 
      major impact on their quality of life. Previous trials suggest that listening to 
      music may be helpful in the treatment of sleep disturbances in healthy populations, 
      including students and elderly. In addition, small studies with clinical populations 
      of traumatized refugees, adults with chronic insomnia and adults with depression 
      insomnia add to the evidence base. However, the impact of music listening in the 
      treatment of depression related insomnia is not well documented. OBJECTIVE: To 
      examine the efficacy of music listening on sleep quality, symptoms of depression, 
      and quality of life in adults with depression-related insomnia. METHOD: A 
      single-center randomized controlled trial (RCT) in a two-arm parallel-group design 
      is conducted and reported according to the CONSORT guidelines. The trial consists of 
      an experimental group and a standard care control group. Both groups receive 
      standard treatment for depression following Danish clinical guidelines in an 
      outpatient psychiatry unit. The experimental group listens to music for a minimum of 
      30 minutes at bedtime for 4 weeks. DISCUSSION: This trial will provide information 
      on the efficacy of music intervention as a non-pharmacological intervention in the 
      treatment of depression-related insomnia. This study will provide novel knowledge 
      concerning music medicine as an evidence-based treatment for depression. TRIAL

TI  - Predicting Fine Spatial Scale Traffic Noise Using Mobile Measurements and Machine 
      Learning.
PG  - 12860-12869
LID - 10.1021/acs.est.0c01987 [doi]
AB  - Environmental noise has been associated with a variety of health endpoints including 
      cardiovascular disease, sleep disturbance, depression, and psychosocial stress. Most 
      population noise exposure comes from vehicular traffic, which produces fine-scale 
      spatial variability that is difficult to characterize using traditional fixed-site 
      measurement techniques. To address this challenge, we collected A-weighted, 
      equivalent noise (LAeq in decibels, dB) data on hour-long foot journeys around 16 
      locations throughout Long Beach, California and trained four machine learning 
      models, linear regression, random forest, extreme gradient boosting, and a neural 
      network, to predict noise with 20 m resolution. Input variables to the models 
      included traffic metrics, road network features, meteorological conditions, and land 
      use type. Among all machine learning models, extreme gradient boosting had the best 
      results in validation tests (leave-one-route-out R(2) = 0.71, root mean square error 
      (RMSE) of 4.54 dB; 5-fold R(2) = 0.96, RMSE of 1.8 dB). Local traffic volume was the 
      most important predictor of noise; road features, land use, and meteorology 
      including humidity, temperature, and wind speed also contributed. We show that a 
      novel, on-foot mobile noise measurement method coupled with machine learning 
      approaches enables highly accurate prediction of small-scale spatial patterns in 
      traffic-related noise over a mixed-use urban area.

TI  - Big Data for Public Health Policy-Making: Policy Empowerment.
PG  - 312-320
LID - 10.1159/000486587 [doi]
AB  - Digitization is considered to radically transform healthcare. As such, with 
      seemingly unlimited opportunities to collect data, it will play an important role in 
      the public health policy-making process. In this context, health data cooperatives 
      (HDC) are a key component and core element for public health policy-making and for 
      exploiting the potential of all the existing and rapidly emerging data sources. 
      Being able to leverage all the data requires overcoming the computational, 
      algorithmic, and technological challenges that characterize today's highly 
      heterogeneous data landscape, as well as a host of diverse regulatory, normative, 
      governance, and policy constraints. The full potential of big data can only be 
      realized if data are being made accessible and shared. Treating research data as a 
      public good, creating HDC to empower citizens through citizen-owned health data, and 
      allowing data access for research and the development of new diagnostics, therapies, 
      and public health policies will yield the transformative impact of digital health. 
      The HDC model for data governance is an arrangement, based on moral codes, that 
      encourages citizens to participate in the improvement of their own health. This then 
      enables public health institutions and policymakers to monitor policy changes and 
      evaluate their impact and risk on a population level.

TI  - CART-analysis embedded in social theory: A case study comparing quantitative data 
      analysis strategies for intersectionality-based public health monitoring within and 
      beyond the binaries.

AB  - Implementation of an intersectionality perspective into quantitative health research 
      might support the process of unravelling complex socio-cultural and economic power 
      relations which underly and shape patterns of health and disease within populations. 
      Intersectionality-informed health monitoring and health reporting integrating a 
      sex/gender-sensitive perspective could serve as a fertile ground to strengthen the 
      essential function of health reporting to support political decision-making. We 
      aimed at the integration of social theory into quantitative data analysis by taking 
      into consideration 4 distinct central sex/gender theoretical concepts in health 
      research. We developed and tested an intersectionality-based, sex/gender-sensitive 
      strategy comparing 5 distinct models based on different combinations of the binary 
      sex/gender variable, socio-cultural and economic variables (defined from an 
      intersectionality perspective) as well as solution-linked sex/gender variables. We 
      used CART-analysis as a quantitative, non-parametric, exploratory method to detect 
      subgroups with high prevalence of frequent mental distress (FMD). Analyses were 
      based on data from a National Health Telephone Interview Survey conducted in 
      Germany. Depending on model and detected subgroup of our comparative approach, 
      prevalence of FMD ranged between approximately 5 %-25%. Within the model including 
      the binary sex/gender variable, socio-cultural and economic variables, sex/gender 
      turned out to be the most important attribute. Comparing the models which included 
      solution-linked sex/gender variables to the model not including these variables 
      illustrated that the CART-algorithm was able to detect subgroups with the same 
      prevalence of FMD, but with approximately 14% as opposed to 4.5% of the study 
      population being affected. For these models, social support served as the primary 
      splitting variable and not the binary sex/gender variable. Including or not 
      including the binary sex/gender variable in the models with the solution-linked 
      variables did not make a substantial difference. Embedding CART-analysis in social 
      theory might have the potential to further sex/gender sensitivity in health 
      reporting and might support decision-making when considering the allocation of 
      health-related interventions.

AB  - Stress reactivity is a complex phenomenon associated to multiple and multimodal 
      expressions. Response to stressors has an obvious survival function and may be seen 
      as an internal regulation to adapt to threat or danger. The intensity of this 
      internal response can be assessed as the self-perception of the stress response. In 
      species with social organization, this response also serves a communicative 
      function, so-called hetero-perception. Our study presents multimodal stress 
      detection assessment - a new methodology combining behavioral imaging and 
      physiological monitoring for analyzing stress from these two perspectives. The 
      system is based on automatic extraction of 39 behavioral (2D+3D video recording) and 
      62 physiological (Nexus-10 recording) features during a socially evaluated mental 
      arithmetic test. The analysis with machine learning techniques for automatic 
      classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM) show that self-perception and 
      hetero-perception of social stress are both close but different phenomena: 
      self-perception was significantly correlated with hetero-perception but 
      significantly differed from it. Also, assessing stress with SVM through 
      multimodality gave excellent classification results (F1 score values: 0.9±0.012 for 
      hetero-perception and 0.87±0.021 for self-perception). In the best selected feature 
      subsets, we found some common behavioral and physiological features that allow 
      classification of both self- and hetero-perceived stress. However, we also found the 
      contributing features for automatic classifications had opposite distributions: 
      self-perception classification was mainly based on physiological features and 
      hetero-perception was mainly based on behavioral features.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak can potentially be categorized as a traumatic 
      event. Public health surveillance is one of the cornerstones of public health 
      practice, and it empowers decision makers to lead and manage public health crises 
      and programs more effectively by providing timely and useful evidence. OBJECTIVE: 
      This paper presents the protocol for a study that aims to identify, track, and 
      monitor trends in the population in Saudi Arabia at risk of major depressive 
      disorders and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This study utilizes 
      continuous, cross-sectional, national-level mental health screening via 
      computer-assisted phone interviews, conducted in four waves on a monthly basis 
      (between May and August 2020). Arabic-speaking adults, aged ≥18 years, and living in 
      Saudi Arabia were recruited via a random phone list. This surveillance system used 
      the proportional quota sampling technique to achieve an equal distribution of 
      participants, stratified by age and gender, and region, within and across the 13 
      administrative regions of Saudi Arabia. A sample size of 4056 participants per wave 
      was calculated to achieve enough power to detect changes in mental health status. 
      The questionnaire includes the Arabic version of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 
      (PHQ-9) to measure depressive symptoms and the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) to 
      measure anxiety. In addition, it will collect data on sociodemographic variables and 
      potential risk factors. RESULTS: Study recruitment began in May 2020. The data 
      analysis was completed in October 2020, and the final report is expected to be 
      published by the end of December 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Monitoring the population's 
      mental health status during the COVID-19 pandemic will inform decision makers of any 
      potential deterioration in mental health on a national level and among subgroups, 
      including across regions, age groups, and gender groups. It will allow decision 
      makers to recognize issues and intervene sooner. It will also provide valuable 
      scientific data to help understand the effects of epidemics and pandemics on mental 
      health. As far as we know, this is the only study that attempts to monitor the 
      mental health status of the general population on a monthly basis. INTERNATIONAL

TI  - Effect of an interprofessional care concept on the hospitalization of nursing home 
      residents: study protocol for a cluster-randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 411

LID - 411
AB  - BACKGROUND: The rising number of nursing home (NH) residents and their increasingly 
      complex treatment needs pose a challenge to the German health care system. In 
      Germany, there is no specialized geriatric medical care for NH residents. Nursing 
      staff and general practitioners (GPs) in particular have to compensate for the 
      additional demand, which is compounded by organizational and structural hurdles. As 
      a result, avoidable emergency calls and hospital admissions occur. In the SaarPHIR 
      project (Saarländische PflegeHeimversorgung Integriert Regelhaft), a complex 
      intervention focusing on a medical care concept was developed in a participatory 
      practice-based approach involving NH representatives and GPs. The complex 
      intervention addresses the collaboration between nurses and GPs and aims to help 
      restructure and optimize the existing daily care routine. It is expected to improve 
      the medical care of geriatric patients in NHs and reduce stressful, costly hospital 
      admissions. The intervention was pilot-tested during the first 12 months of the 
      project. In the present study, its effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and safety 
      will be evaluated. METHODS: The study is a cluster-randomized controlled trial, 
      comparing an intervention group with a control group. The intervention includes a 
      concept of interprofessional collaboration, in which GPs group into regional 
      cooperating teams. Teams are encouraged to cooperate more closely with NH staff and 
      to provide on-call schedules, pre-weekend visits, joint team meetings, joint 
      documentation, and improved medication safety. At least 32 NHs in Saarland, Germany 
      (with at least 50 residents each) will be included and monitored for 12 months. The 
      primary endpoint is hospitalization. Secondary endpoints are quality of life, 
      quality of care, and medication safety. The control group receives treatment as 
      usual. Process evaluation and health economic evaluation accompany the study. The 
      data set contains claims data from German statutory health insurance companies as 
      well as primary data. Analysis will be conducted using a generalized linear mixed 
      model. CONCLUSION: A reduction in hospital admissions of NH residents and relevant 
      changes in secondary endpoints are expected. In turn, these will have a positive 
      impact on the economic assessment. TRIAL REGISTRATION: German Clinical Trials

TI  - Tracking and Analyzing Individual Distress Following Terrorist Attacks Using Social 
      Media Streams.
PG  - 1580-1605
LID - 10.1111/risa.12829 [doi]
AB  - Risk research has theorized a number of mechanisms that might trigger, prolong, or 
      potentially alleviate individuals' distress following terrorist attacks. These 
      mechanisms are difficult to examine in a single study, however, because the social 
      conditions of terrorist attacks are difficult to simulate in laboratory experiments 
      and appropriate preattack baselines are difficult to establish with surveys. To 
      address this challenge, we propose the use of computational focus groups and a novel 
      analysis framework to analyze a social media stream that archives user history and 
      location. The approach uses time-stamped behavior to quantify an individual's 
      preattack behavior after an attack has occurred, enabling the assessment of 
      time-specific changes in the intensity and duration of an individual's distress, as 
      well as the assessment of individual and social-level covariates. To exemplify the 
      methodology, we collected over 18 million tweets from 15,509 users located in Paris 
      on November 13, 2015, and measured the degree to which they expressed anxiety, 
      anger, and sadness after the attacks. The analysis resulted in findings that would 
      be difficult to observe through other methods, such as that news media exposure had 
      competing, time-dependent effects on anxiety, and that gender dynamics are 
      complicated by baseline behavior. Opportunities for integrating computational focus 
      group analysis with traditional methods are discussed.

TI  - A data-driven analysis, and its limitations, of the spatial flood archive of 
      Flanders, Belgium to assess the impact of soil sealing on flood volume and extent.
PG  - e0239583
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0239583 [doi]
LID - e0239583
AB  - Soil sealing increases surface runoff in a watershed and decreases infiltration into 
      the soil. Consequently, urbanization poses a significant challenge for watershed 
      management to mitigate faster runoff accumulation downstream and associated floods. 
      Hydrological models are often employed to assess the impact of land-use dynamics on 
      flood events. Alternatively, data-driven approaches combining time series of land 
      use geodatasets and georeferenced flooded zones also allow to assess the 
      relationship between soil sealing and flood severity. This study presents such 
      data-driven analysis using a spatially explicit archive of flooded areas dating back 
      to 1988 in the Flanders region of Belgium, which is characterized by urban sprawl. 
      This archived data, along with time series of rainfall and land use, were analyzed 
      for three middle-sized river subbasins using two machine learning methods: boosted 
      regression trees and support vector regression. The machine learning methods were 
      found suitable for this type of analysis, since their flexibility allows for 
      spatially explicit models with larger sample sizes. However, the relationship 
      between soil sealing and flood volume and extent could not be conclusively confirmed 
      by our models. This may be due to data limitations, such as the limited number of 
      recorded historical floods, inaccuracies in recorded historical flood polygons and 
      inconsistencies in the land use classifications. It is therefore stressed that 
      continued consistent monitoring of floods and land use changes is required.

TI  - Voice perturbations under the stress overload in young individuals: phenotyping and 
      suboptimal health as predictors for cascading pathologies.
PG  - 1-11
LID - 10.1007/s13167-020-00229-8 [doi]
AB  - Verbal communication is one of the most sophisticated human motor skills reflecting 
      both-the mental and physical health of an individual. Voice parameters and quality 
      changes are usually secondary towards functional and/or structural laryngological 
      alterations under specific systemic processes, syndrome and pathologies. These 
      include but are not restricted to dry mouth and Sicca syndromes, body dehydration, 
      hormonal alterations linked to pubertal, menopausal, and andropausal status, 
      respiratory disorders, gastrointestinal reflux, autoimmune diseases, endocrinologic 
      disorders, underweight versus overweight and obesity, and diabetes mellitus. On the 
      other hand, it is well-established that stress overload is a significant risk factor 
      of cascading pathologies, including but not restricted to neurodegenerative and 
      psychiatric disorders, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and 
      cancers. Our current study revealed voice perturbations under the stress overload as 
      a potentially useful biomarker to identify individuals in suboptimal health 
      conditions who might be strongly predisposed to associated pathologies. 
      Contextually, extended surveys applied in the population might be useful to 
      identify, for example, persons at high risk for respiratory complications under 
      pandemic conditions such as COVID-19. Symptoms of dry mouth syndrome, disturbed 
      microcirculation, altered sense regulation, shifted circadian rhythm, and low BMI 
      were positively associated with voice perturbations under the stress overload. Their 
      functional interrelationships and relevance for cascading associated pathologies are 
      presented in the article. Automated analysis of voice recordings via artificial 
      intelligence (AI) has a potential to derive digital biomarkers. Further, predictive 
      machine learning models should be developed that allows for detecting a suboptimal 
      health condition based on voice recordings, ideally in an automated manner using 
      derived digital biomarkers. Follow-up stratification and monitoring of individuals 
      in suboptimal health conditions are recommended using disease-specific cell-free 
      nucleic acids (ccfDNA, ctDNA, mtDNA, miRNA) combined with metabolic patterns 
      detected in body fluids. Application of the cost-effective targeted prevention 
      within the phase of reversible health damage is recommended based on the 
      individualised patient profiling.

TI  - Low Molecular Weight Volatile Organic Compounds Indicate Grazing by the Marine 
      Rotifer Brachionus plicatilis on the Microalgae Microchloropsis salina.
LID - 10.3390/metabo10090361 [doi]

AB  - Microalgae produce specific chemicals indicative of stress and/or death. The aim of 
      this study was to perform non-destructive monitoring of algal culture systems, in 
      the presence and absence of grazers, to identify potential biomarkers of incipient 
      pond crashes. Here, we report ten volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are 
      robustly generated by the marine alga, Microchloropsis salina, in the presence 
      and/or absence of the marine grazer, Brachionus plicatilis. We cultured M. salina 
      with and without B. plicatilis and collected in situ volatile headspace samples 
      using thermal desorption tubes over the course of several days. Data from four 
      experiments were aggregated, deconvoluted, and chromatographically aligned to 
      determine VOCs with tentative identifications made via mass spectral library 
      matching. VOCs generated by algae in the presence of actively grazing rotifers were 
      confirmed via pure analytical standards to be pentane, 3-pentanone, 3-methylhexane, 
      and 2-methylfuran. Six other VOCs were less specifically associated with grazing but 
      were still commonly observed between the four replicate experiments. Through this 
      work, we identified four biomarkers of rotifer grazing that indicate algal 
      stress/death. This will aid machine learning algorithms to chemically define and 
      diagnose algal mass production cultures and save algae cultures from imminent crash 
      to make biofuel an alternative energy possibility.

TI  - Stem diameter variations as a versatile research tool in ecophysiology.
PG  - 1047-61
LID - 10.1093/treephys/tpv080 [doi]
AB  - High-resolution stem diameter variations (SDV) are widely recognized as a useful 
      drought stress indicator and have therefore been used in many irrigation scheduling 
      studies. More recently, SDV have been used in combination with other plant 
      measurements and biophysical modelling to study fundamental mechanisms underlying 
      whole-plant functioning and growth. The present review aims to scrutinize the 
      important insights emerging from these more recent SDV applications to identify 
      trends in ongoing fundamental research. The main mechanism underlying SDV is 
      variation in water content in stem tissues, originating from reversible shrinkage 
      and swelling of dead and living tissues, and irreversible growth. The contribution 
      of different stem tissues to the overall SDV signal is currently under debate and 
      shows variation with species and plant age, but can be investigated by combining SDV 
      with state-of-the-art technology like magnetic resonance imaging. Various 
      physiological mechanisms, such as water and carbon transport, and mechanical 
      properties influence the SDV pattern, making it an extensive source of information 
      on dynamic plant behaviour. To unravel these dynamics and to extract information on 
      plant physiology or plant biophysics from SDV, mechanistic modelling has proved to 
      be valuable. Biophysical models integrate different mechanisms underlying SDV, and 
      help us to explain the resulting SDV signal. Using an elementary modelling approach, 
      we demonstrate the application of SDV as a tool to examine plant water relations, 
      plant hydraulics, plant carbon relations, plant nutrition, freezing effects, plant 
      phenology and dendroclimatology. In the ever-expanding SDV knowledge base we 
      identified two principal research tracks. First, in detailed short-term experiments, 
      SDV measurements are combined with other plant measurements and modelling to 
      discover patterns in phloem turgor, phloem osmotic concentrations, root pressure and 
      plant endogenous control. Second, long-term SDV time series covering many different 
      species, regions and climates provide an expanding amount of phenotypic data of 
      growth, phenology and survival in relation to microclimate, soil water availability, 
      species or genotype, which can be coupled with genetic information to support 
      ecological and breeding research under on-going global change. This under-exploited 
      source of information has now encouraged research groups to set up coordinated 
      initiatives to explore this data pool via global analysis techniques and 
      data-mining.

TI  - Applications of Google Search Trends for risk communication in infectious disease 
      management: A case study of the COVID-19 outbreak in Taiwan.
PG  - 221-223
LID - S1201-9712(20)30140-5 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.021 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: An emerging outbreak of a novel coronavirus, COVID-19, has now been 
      detected in at least 211 countries worldwide. Given this pandemic situation, robust 
      risk communication is urgently needed, particularly in affected countries. 
      Therefore, this study explored the potential use of Google Trends (GT) to monitor 
      public restlessness toward COVID-19 infection in Taiwan. METHODS: We retrieved GT 
      data for the specific locations and subregions in Taiwan nationwide using defined 
      search terms related to the coronavirus, handwashing, and face masks. RESULTS: 
      Searches related to COVID-19 and face masks in Taiwan rapidly increased following 
      the announcements of Taiwan's first imported case and reached a peak as locally 
      acquired cases were reported. However, searches for handwashing gradually increased 
      during the period of face-mask shortage. Moreover, high to moderate correlations 
      between Google relative search volumes (RSVs) and COVID-19 cases were found in 
      Taipei (lag-3), New Taipei (lag-2), Taoyuan (lag-2), Tainan (lag-1), Taichung 
      (lag0), and Kaohsiung (lag0). CONCLUSION: In response to the ongoing outbreak, our 
      results demonstrated that GT could potentially define the proper timing and location 
      for practicing appropriate risk communication strategies for affected populations.

TI  - The limitations of using randomised controlled trials as a basis for developing 
      treatment guidelines.
PG  - 4-6
LID - 10.1136/eb-2017-102701 [doi]
AB  - Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are considered the 'gold standard' by which 
      novel psychotropic medications and psychological interventions are evaluated and 
      consequently adopted into widespread clinical practice. However, there are some 
      limitations to using RCTs as the basis for developing treatment guidelines. While 
      RCTs allow researchers to determine whether a given medication or intervention is 
      effective in a specific patient sample, for practicing clinicians it is more 
      important to know whether it will work for their particular patient in their 
      particular setting. This information cannot be garnered from an RCT. These inherent 
      limitations are exacerbated by biases in design, recruitment, sample populations and 
      data analysis that are inevitable in real-world studies. While trial registration 
      and CONSORT have been implemented to correct and improve these issues, it is 
      worrying that many trials fail to achieve such standards and yet their findings are 
      used to inform clinical decision making. This perspective piece questions the 
      assumptions of RCTs and highlights the widespread distortion of findings that 
      currently undermine the credibility of this powerful design. It is recommended that 
      the clinical guidelines include advice as to what should be considered good and 
      relevant evidence and that external bodies continue to monitor RCTs to ensure that 
      the outcomes published indeed reflect reality.

TI  - A Biological Signal-Based Stress Monitoring Framework for Children Using Wearable 
      Devices.
LID - 10.3390/s17091936 [doi]
LID - 1936
AB  - The safety of children has always been an important issue, and several studies have 
      been conducted to determine the stress state of a child to ensure the safety. Audio 
      signals and biological signals including heart rate are known to be effective for 
      stress state detection. However, collecting those data requires specialized 
      equipment, which is not appropriate for the constant monitoring of children, and 
      advanced data analysis is required for accurate detection. In this regard, we 
      propose a stress state detection framework which utilizes both audio signal and 
      heart rate collected from wearable devices, and adopted machine learning methods for 
      the detection. Experiments using real-world data were conducted to compare detection 
      performances across various machine learning methods and noise levels of audio 
      signal. Adopting the proposed framework in the real-world will contribute to the 
      enhancement of child safety.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It is widely acknowledged that the experiences of frontline primary 
      health care professionals during COVID-19 are important to understand how they 
      respond and act under situations of pandemic as the gatekeepers in primary health 
      care system. School nurses are primary health care professionals who lead health 
      care in schools and practice in a holistic manner to address the needs of 
      schoolchildren and school personnel. There are rising mental health concerns of 
      frontline health care professionals with anxiety and panic disorders, somatic 
      symptoms, and feeling isolated. No studies use a qualitative study approach to 
      document community frontline school nursing professionals' experiences and 
      challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hence, understanding the school nurses' 
      experiences and challenges to fight against COVID-19 in the communities is 
      important. PURPOSE: This study aims to explore the experiences of school nurses 
      during the COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong. METHODS: A qualitative study design 
      adopted the principles of thematic analysis. Nineteen school nurses were recruited 
      to participate in individual semistructured interviews and shared their roles and 
      responsibilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. FINDINGS: Three themes indicated the 
      school nurses' expand professional responsibilities to fight against COVID-19 
      emerged from the data analysis. These were "Managing Stress," "Navigating the School 
      Through the Pandemic," and "Raising the Profile of the School Nurse Professional," 
      DISCUSSION: Findings reveal the important role of school nursing professionals in 
      minimizing the community-wide risk posed by pandemics and the need to integrate them 
      into planning and implementation of school health policies and guidelines in the 
      primary health care system. This essential role in schools is necessary to assess, 
      implement, monitor, prevent, and reduce the spread of virus in school communities 
      and to minimize the burden to and extra health care resources utilized in the acute 
      care setting during COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - Postpartum Bleeding in Pregnant Women Receiving SSRIs/SNRIs: New Insights From a 
      Descriptive Observational Study and an Analysis of Data from the FAERS Database.

AB  - PURPOSE: To date, the available data on the relationship between the use of 
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or the serotonin and norepinephrine 
      reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) venlafaxine and postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) are 
      conflicting and have not been extensively investigated, especially in terms of 
      plasma drug concentrations. We performed data mining of antidepressant-induced PPH 
      reported to the US Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System 
      database, to assess the strength of the potential association between antidepressant 
      pharmacotherapy and PPH in pregnant women. Concurrently, we carried out a 
      descriptive observational population (pregnant women) analysis of the correlation 
      between the plasma concentrations of SSRIs/SNRIs used during pregnancy and the 
      extent of bleeding at delivery. METHODS: A disproportionality analysis of individual 
      case study reports of PPH associated with SSRIs or venlafaxine in pregnant women was 
      performed. Reporting odds ratio was used as a measure of disproportionality 
      analysis. Pregnant women treated with an SSRI or SNRI (venlafaxine) for depressive 
      or anxiety disorder and who consented to plasma drug concentration monitoring at the 
      time of delivery were recruited. Plasma drug concentration assay was performed 
      according to validated LC-MS/MS. Based on plasma drug concentrations, patients were 
      classified into 1 of 2 groups, in therapeutic range or below therapeutic range for 
      the drug administered, in accordance with the Arbeitsgemeinschaft für 
      Neuropsychopharmakologie und Pharmakopsychiatrie guideline, and correlations with 
      blood loss were identified, with PPH defined as a blood loss of >500 mL. FINDINGS: 
      Only 43 Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) reported at least one SSRIs or 
      venlafaxine as suspect drug in 14 years (database analyses). Forty-three women were 
      enrolled in the study population (observational study). In 24 patients (55.8%) the 
      plasma drug concentration was below the therapeutic threshold. Unexpectedly, the 
      mean blood loss in the below-range group was significantly higher than that in the 
      in-range group. PPH occurred in 30% of women: in 9.3% and in 20.7% of patients in 
      the in-range and below-range groups, respectively. IMPLICATIONS: Although 
      preliminary, these data indicate a rather good tolerability profile of SSRIs/SNRIs 
      regarding postpartum bleeding. Moreover, they suggest that keeping the plasma levels 
      of SSRIs/SNRIs low as a precautionary measure does not reduce postpartum bleeding, 
      which was higher in the below-range group. The findings from this study suggest that 
      the use of therapeutic drug monitoring in pregnancy, a period in which multiple 
      variables affect drug metabolism, may allow for better treatment customization, with 
      subsequent advantages in terms of tolerability and efficacy of treatment.

TI  - Relationships Between Heart Rate Variability, Occupational Performance, and Fitness 
      for Tactical Personnel: A Systematic Review.
PG  - 583336
LID - 10.3389/fpubh.2020.583336 [doi]
LID - 583336
AB  - Objectives: Heart Rate Variability has gained substantial interest in both clinical 
      and athletic settings as a measurement tool for quantifying autonomic nervous system 
      activity and psychophysiological stress. However, its uses in tactical work 
      settings, such as military, police, and firefighting environments, remain 
      controversial. Given the physical, mental, and emotional stress public safety 
      personnel face both operationally and in training, heart rate variability 
      measurement may be key in promoting their health, safety and operational 
      effectiveness. Methods: This study identified, critically appraised, and summarized 
      primary studies investigating relationships between heart rate variability and 
      outcomes of interest to tactical personnel. Key literature databases were searched, 
      and quality assessment checklists were applied to analyze retained literature. The 
      results of the screening and assessment processes, along with key data extracted 
      from each study were summarized and tabulated. Research gaps were also identified to 
      facilitate improvements to how tactical personnel and health or performance 
      providers may best utilize heart rate variability to monitor or promote personnel 
      health and performance, and thereby facilitate public safety. Results: Twenty 
      studies were included and were all of generally high quality. Cohort size, length of 
      follow-up, measurement objectives, data acquisition, and data analysis all varied 
      considerably across studies, precluding meta-analysis. However, study results 
      correlating heart rate variability and relevant outcomes indicated that overall, 
      heart rate variability is an effective indicator of key fitness and performance 
      elements in the tactical work setting. Conclusions: Heart rate variability can be an 
      effective health and performance tool in tactical work environments. However, 
      measurement methods must be carefully selected and applied. Further research is 
      required to understand causal relationships. Specifically, larger cohort inclusion 
      and the isolation and study of specific variables unique to public safety work and 
      training may improve the effectiveness of heart rate variability measurement to 
      provide meaningful information to end users and providers.

TI  - Multiscale Information Decomposition Dissects Control Mechanisms of Heart Rate 
      Variability at Rest and During Physiological Stress.
LID - 10.3390/e21050526 [doi]
LID - 526
AB  - Heart rate variability (HRV; variability of the RR interval of the 
      electrocardiogram) results from the activity of several coexisting control 
      mechanisms, which involve the influence of respiration (RESP) and systolic blood 
      pressure (SBP) oscillations operating across multiple temporal scales and changing 
      in different physiological states. In this study, multiscale information 
      decomposition is used to dissect the physiological mechanisms related to the genesis 
      of HRV in 78 young volunteers monitored at rest and during postural and mental 
      stress evoked by head-up tilt (HUT) and mental arithmetics (MA). After representing 
      RR, RESP and SBP at different time scales through a recently proposed method based 
      on multivariate state space models, the joint information transfer T RESP , SBP → RR 
      is decomposed into unique, redundant and synergistic components, describing the 
      strength of baroreflex modulation independent of respiration ( U SBP → RR ), 
      nonbaroreflex ( U RESP → RR ) and baroreflex-mediated ( R RESP , SBP → RR ) 
      respiratory influences, and simultaneous presence of baroreflex and nonbaroreflex 
      respiratory influences ( S RESP , SBP → RR ), respectively. We find that fast (short 
      time scale) HRV oscillations-respiratory sinus arrhythmia-originate from the 
      coexistence of baroreflex and nonbaroreflex (central) mechanisms at rest, with a 
      stronger baroreflex involvement during HUT. Focusing on slower HRV oscillations, the 
      baroreflex origin is dominant and MA leads to its higher involvement. Respiration 
      influences independent on baroreflex are present at long time scales, and are 
      enhanced during HUT.

AB  - Earthworms, as the first choice for soil monitoring and bio-remediation of cadmium 
      (Cd)-contaminated soil, need to identify its mechanism under Cd stress. In this 
      study, an artificial soil test method was used to determine the oxidative stress 
      reaction indices, amino acid composition, and microbial community changes in 
      earthworms under different stress durations and concentrations. For the first time, 
      the canonical correlation analysis model and path analysis model were innovatively 
      introduced into the data analysis to determine the mechanism that drives earthworm 
      physiological functions after Cd stress. The results showed that in the low-stress 
      concentration treatments (50-125 mg.kg(-1) DW), there was a driving relationship 
      between oxidative stress reaction and microbial community in earthworm, and the 
      driving factor was glycyl-L-glutamic acid at 50 mg.kg(-1) DW. With the increase of 
      Cd stress intensity, the enzymes of oxidative stress promoted the survival microbes 
      to begin to proliferate, and SOD became the main driving factor under 125 mg.kg(-1) 
      DW Cd stress. In the high-stress concentration treatments (250-500 mg.kg(-1) DW), 
      the driving effects were weakened or disappeared; while Cd-resistant microbial 
      population appeared. This study provides a theoretical basis for the driving 
      mechanism between oxidative stress effect and microbial community after Cd stress.

AB  - The high impact of irrigation in crop quality and yield in grapevine makes the 
      development of plant water status monitoring systems an essential issue in the 
      context of sustainable viticulture. This study presents an on-the-go approach for 
      the estimation of vineyard water status using thermal imaging and machine learning. 
      The experiments were conducted during seven different weeks from July to September 
      in season 2016. A thermal camera was embedded on an all-terrain vehicle moving at 5 
      km/h to take on-the-go thermal images of the vineyard canopy at 1.2 m of distance 
      and 1.0 m from the ground. The two sides of the canopy were measured for the 
      development of side-specific and global models. Stem water potential was acquired 
      and used as reference method. Additionally, reference temperatures Tdry and Twet 
      were determined for the calculation of two thermal indices: the crop water stress 
      index (CWSI) and the Jones index (Ig). Prediction models were built with and without 
      considering the reference temperatures as input of the training algorithms. When 
      using the reference temperatures, the best models casted determination coefficients 
      R2 of 0.61 and 0.58 for cross validation and prediction (RMSE values of 0.190 MPa 
      and 0.204 MPa), respectively. Nevertheless, when the reference temperatures were not 
      considered in the training of the models, their performance statistics responded in 
      the same way, returning R2 values up to 0.62 and 0.65 for cross validation and 
      prediction (RMSE values of 0.190 MPa and 0.184 MPa), respectively. The outcomes 
      provided by the machine learning algorithms support the use of thermal imaging for 
      fast, reliable estimation of a vineyard water status, even suppressing the necessity 
      of supervised acquisition of reference temperatures. The new developed on-the-go 
      method can be very useful in the grape and wine industry for assessing and mapping 
      vineyard water status.

AB  - The development of high-performance photobioreactors equipped with automatic systems 
      for non-invasive real-time monitoring of cultivation conditions and photosynthetic 
      parameters is a challenge in algae biotechnology. Therefore, we developed a 
      chlorophyll (Chl) fluorescence measuring system for the online recording of the 
      light-induced fluorescence rise and the dark relaxation of the flash-induced 
      fluorescence yield (Qa(-) - re-oxidation kinetics) in photobioreactors. This system 
      provides automatic measurements in a broad range of Chl concentrations at high 
      frequency of gas-tight sampling, and advanced data analysis. The performance of this 
      new technique was tested on the green microalgae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii subjected 
      to a sulfur deficiency stress and to long-term dark anaerobic conditions. More than 
      thousand fluorescence kinetic curves were recorded and analyzed during aerobic and 
      anaerobic stages of incubation. Lifetime and amplitude values of kinetic components 
      were determined, and their dynamics plotted on heatmaps. Out of these data, 
      stress-sensitive kinetic parameters were specified. This implemented apparatus can 
      therefore be useful for the continuous real-time monitoring of algal photosynthesis 
      in photobioreactors.

AB  - Bee pollinators are exposed to multiple natural and anthropogenic stressors. 
      Understanding the effects of a single stressor in the complex environmental context 
      of antagonistic/synergistic interactions is critical to pollinator monitoring and 
      may serve as early warning system before a pollination crisis. This study aimed to 
      methodically improve the diagnosis of bee stressors using a simultaneous untargeted 
      and targeted metabolomics-based approach. Analysis of 84 Bombus terrestris hemolymph 
      samples found 8 metabolites retained as potential biomarkers that showed excellent 
      discrimination for nutritional stress. In parallel, 8 significantly altered 
      metabolites, as revealed by targeted profiling, were also assigned as candidate 
      biomarkers. Furthermore, machine learning algorithms were applied to the 
      above-described two biomarker sets, whereby the untargeted eight components showed 
      the best classification performance with sensitivity and specificity up to 99% and 
      100%, respectively. Based on pathway and biochemistry analysis, we propose that 
      gluconeogenesis contributed significantly to blood sugar stability in bumblebees 
      maintained on a low carbohydrate diet. Taken together, this study demonstrates that 
      metabolomics-based biomarker discovery holds promising potential for improving bee 
      health monitoring and to identify stressor related to energy intake and other 
      environmental stressors.

TI  - Development of the delta-normal stress combining CE-QUAL-W2 as a novel method for 
      spatio-temporal monitoring of water quality in Karkheh Dam Reservoir.
PG  - 312
LID - 10.1007/s10661-020-08295-1 [doi]
AB  - Continuous monitoring of water quality in dam reservoirs is a typically difficult 
      and costly operation. In this study, the results of computer modeling with the 
      CE-QUAL-W2 model were combined with data mining techniques to develop a new method 
      called "delta-normal stress" for identifying the critical temporal and spatial 
      monitoring ranges. For this purpose, long-term variations of three quality 
      parameters including nitrite-nitrate level, dissolved oxygen (DO) level, and water 
      temperature near the outlet of the dam, which is the point of interest for reservoir 
      exploitation, were analyzed. Based on this analysis, the time intervals and depth 
      ranges with the highest frequency of significant variations in terms of each 
      parameter were identified. The results showed that given the difference between the 
      delta-normal stress trend of temperature and that of other parameters in Karkheh Dam 
      Reservoir, temperature can be monitored at much lower sampling resolutions and using 
      cheaper methods and equipment without sacrificing accuracy. Based on the frequency 
      of occurrence of delta-normal stress of more than 20% above the total average, the 
      key sampling times and locations for nitrite-nitrate and DO levels were determined 
      to be the periods of January-February, February-March, and March-April, and depths 
      of 60, 55, 50, and 5 m, respectively.

AB  - Falls are a major cause of injuries and deaths in older adults. Even when no injury 
      occurs, about half of all older adults who fall are unable to get up without 
      assistance. The extended period of lying on the floor often leads to medical 
      complications, including muscle damage, dehydration, anxiety and fear of falling. 
      Wearable sensor systems incorporating accelerometers and/or gyroscopes are designed 
      to prevent long lies by automatically detecting and alerting care providers to the 
      occurrence of a fall. Research groups have reported up to 100% accuracy in detecting 
      falls in experimental settings. However, there is a lack of studies examining 
      accuracy in the real-world setting. In this study, we examined the accuracy of a 
      fall detection system based on real-world fall and non-fall data sets. Five young 
      adults and 19 older adults went about their daily activities while wearing tri-axial 
      accelerometers. Older adults experienced 10 unanticipated falls during the data 
      collection. Approximately 400 hours of activities of daily living were recorded. We 
      employed a machine learning algorithm, Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, to 
      identify falls and non-fall events. We found that our system was able to detect 8 
      out of the 10 falls in older adults using signals from a single accelerometer (waist 
      or sternum). Furthermore, our system did not report any false alarm during 
      approximately 28.5 hours of recorded data from young adults. However, with older 
      adults, the false positive rate among individuals ranged from 0 to 0.3 false alarms 
      per hour. While our system showed higher fall detection and substantially lower 
      false positive rate than the existing fall detection systems, there is a need for 
      continuous efforts to collect real-world data within the target population to 
      perform fall validation studies for fall detection systems on bigger real-world fall 
      and non-fall datasets.

LID - 10.1161/JAHA.117.006053 [doi]
LID - e006053
AB  - BACKGROUND: Individuals who exhibit large-magnitude blood pressure (BP) reactions to 
      acute psychological stressors are at risk for hypertension and premature death by 
      cardiovascular disease. This study tested whether a multivariate pattern of 
      stressor-evoked brain activity could reliably predict individual differences in BP 
      reactivity, providing novel evidence for a candidate neurophysiological source of 
      stress-related cardiovascular risk. METHODS AND RESULTS: Community-dwelling adults 
      (N=310; 30-51 years; 153 women) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging with 
      concurrent BP monitoring while completing a standardized battery of stressor tasks. 
      Across individuals, the battery evoked an increase systolic and diastolic BP 
      relative to a nonstressor baseline period (M ∆systolic BP/∆diastolic 
      BP=4.3/1.9 mm Hg [95% confidence interval=3.7-5.0/1.4-2.3 mm Hg]). Using 
      cross-validation and machine learning approaches, including dimensionality reduction 
      and linear shrinkage models, a multivariate pattern of stressor-evoked functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging activity was identified in a training subsample (N=206). 
      This multivariate pattern reliably predicted both systolic BP (r=0.32; P<0.005) and 
      diastolic BP (r=0.25; P<0.01) reactivity in an independent subsample used for 
      testing and replication (N=104). Brain areas encompassed by the pattern that were 
      strongly predictive included those implicated in psychological stressor processing 
      and cardiovascular responding through autonomic pathways, including the medial 
      prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and insula. CONCLUSIONS: A novel 
      multivariate pattern of stressor-evoked brain activity may comprise a phenotype that 
      partly accounts for individual differences in BP reactivity, a stress-related 
      cardiovascular risk factor.

AB  - The earthquake rupture process comprises complex interactions of stress, fracture, 
      and frictional properties. New machine learning methods demonstrate great potential 
      to reveal patterns in time-dependent spectral properties of seismic signals and 
      enable identification of changes in faulting processes. Clustering of 46,000 
      earthquakes of 0.3 < M(L) < 1.5 from the Geysers geothermal field (CA) yields 
      groupings that have no reservoir-scale spatial patterns but clear temporal patterns. 
      Events with similar spectral properties repeat on annual cycles within each cluster 
      and track changes in the water injection rates into the Geysers reservoir, 
      indicating that changes in acoustic properties and faulting processes accompany 
      changes in thermomechanical state. The methods open new means to identify and 
      characterize subtle changes in seismic source properties, with applications to 
      tectonic and geothermal seismicity.

TI  - Unsmoothed functional MRI of the human amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria 
      terminalis during processing of emotional faces.

AB  - Functional neuroimaging of the human amygdala has been of great interest to uncover 
      the neural underpinnings of emotions, mood, motivation, social cognition, and 
      decision making, as well as their dysfunction in psychiatric disorders. Yet, several 
      factors limit in vivo imaging of amygdalar function, most importantly its location 
      deep within the temporal lobe adjacent to air-filled cavities that cause magnetic 
      field inhomogeneities entailing signal dropouts. Additionally, the amygdala and the 
      extended amygdalar region consist of several substructures, which have been assigned 
      different functions and have important implications for functional and effective 
      connectivity studies. Here we show that high-resolution ultra-high field fMRI at 7T 
      can be used to overcome these fundamental challenges for acquisition and can meet 
      some of the demands posed by the complex neuroanatomy and -physiology in this 
      region. Utilizing the inherently high SNR, we use an optimized preprocessing and 
      data analysis strategy to demonstrate that imaging of the (extended) amygdala is 
      highly reliable and robust. Using unsmoothed single-subject data allowed us to 
      differentiate brain activation during processing of emotional faces in the central 
      and basolateral amygdala and, for the first time, in the bed nucleus of the stria 
      terminalis (BNST), which is critically involved in the neural mechanisms of anxiety 
      and threat monitoring. We also provide a quantitative assessment of single subject 
      sensitivity, which is relevant for connectivity studies that rely on time course 
      extraction of functionally-defined volumes of interest.

TI  - Binocular Vision, Visual Function, and Pupil Dynamics in People Living With Dementia 
      and Their Relation to the Rate of Cognitive Decline and Structural Changes Within 
      the Brain: Protocol for an Observational Study.
PG  - e16089
LID - 10.2196/16089 [doi]
LID - e16089
AB  - BACKGROUND: Visual impairment is a common comorbidity in people living with 
      dementia. Addressing sources of visual difficulties can have a significant impact on 
      the quality of life for people living with dementia and their caregivers. Depth 
      perception problems are purportedly common in dementia and also contribute to falls, 
      visuomotor task difficulties, and poorer psychosocial well-being. However, depth 
      perception and binocular vision are rarely assessed in dementia research. Sleep 
      fragmentation is also common for people living with dementia, and binocular 
      cooperation for depth perception can be affected by fatigue. Pupillary responses 
      under cognitive load also have the potential to be a risk marker for cognitive 
      decline in people living with dementia and can be combined with the above measures 
      for a comprehensive evaluation of clinical visual changes in people living with 
      dementia and their relation to changes in cognitive status, sleep quality, and 
      cortical structure or function. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to characterize the 
      nature of clinical visual changes and altered task-evoked pupillary responses that 
      may occur in people living with dementia and evaluate whether these responses relate 
      to changes in cognitive status (standardized Mini Mental State Examination [MMSE] 
      score), Pittsburgh sleep quality index, and cortical structure or function. METHODS: 
      This proposed exploratory observational study will enroll ≤210 people with recently 
      diagnosed dementia (within the last 24 months). The following parameters will be 
      assessed on 3 occasions, 4 months apart (plus or minus 2 weeks): visual function 
      (visual acuity and contrast sensitivity), binocular function (motor fusion and 
      stereopsis), task-evoked pupillary responses (minimum and maximum pupil size, time 
      to maximum dilation, and dilation velocity), cognitive status (MMSE score), and 
      sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index). A subset of patients (n=30) with 
      Alzheimer disease will undergo structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging 
      at first and third visits, completing a 10-day consensus sleep diary to monitor 
      sleep quality, verified by sleep actimetry. RESULTS: This research was funded in 
      February 2018 and received National Health Service Research Ethics Committee 
      approval in September 2018. The data collection period was from October 1, 2018, to 
      November 30, 2019. A total of 24 participants were recruited for the study. The data 
      analysis is complete, with results expected to be published before the end of 2020. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Findings will demonstrate how often people with dementia experience 
      binocular vision problems. If frequent, diagnosing and treating them could improve 
      quality of life by reducing the risk of falls and fine visuomotor task impairment 
      and by relieving psychosocial anxiety. This research will also demonstrate whether 
      changes in depth perception, pupillary responses, and quality of vision relate to 
      changes in memory or sleep quality and brain structure or function. If related, 
      these quick and noninvasive eye tests help monitor dementia. This would help justify 
      whether binocular vision and pupillary response testing should be included in 
      dementia-friendly eye-testing guidelines. INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER

AB  - BACKGROUND: Thyrotoxicosis is a common disease caused by an excess of thyroid 
      hormones. The prevalence of thyrotoxicosis about 2% and 70-90% of thyrotoxicosis 
      cases are caused by Graves' disease, an autoimmune disease, which has a high 
      recurrence rate when treated with antithyroid drugs such as methimazole or 
      propylthiouracil. The clinical symptoms and signs of thyrotoxicosis include 
      palpitation, weight loss, restlessness, and difficulty sleeping. Although these 
      clinical changes in thyrotoxicosis can be detected by currently available wearable 
      activity trackers, there have been few trials of the clinical application of 
      wearable devices in patients with thyrotoxicosis. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study 
      is to investigate the clinical applicability of wearable device-generated data to 
      the management of thyrotoxicosis. We are analyzing continuously monitored data for 
      heart rate, physical activity, and sleep in patients with thyrotoxicosis during 
      their clinical course after treatment. METHODS: Thirty thyrotoxic patients and 10 
      control subjects were enrolled in this study at Seoul National University Bundang 
      Hospital. Heart rate, physical activity, and sleep are being monitored using a 
      Fitbit Charge HR or Fitbit Charge 2. Clinical data including anthropometric 
      measures, thyroid function test, and hyperthyroidism symptom scale are recorded. 
      RESULTS: Study enrollment began in December 2016, and the intervention and follow-up 
      phases are ongoing. The results of the data analysis are expected to be available by 
      September 2017. CONCLUSIONS: This study will provide a foundational feasibility 
      trial of the clinical applications of biosignal measurements to the differential 
      diagnosis, prediction of clinical course, early detection of recurrence, and 
      treatment in patients with thyrotoxicosis. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov

AB  - COVID-19, an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered enveloped virus 
      (SARS-CoV-2), was first reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and affected the 
      whole world. The infected individual may develop symptoms such as high fever, cough, 
      myalgia, lymphopenia, respiratory distress syndrome etc. or remain completely 
      asymptomatic after the incubation period of two to fourteen days. As the virus is 
      transmitted by inhaling infectious respiratory droplets that are produced by 
      sneezing or coughing, so early and rapid diagnosis of the disease can prevent 
      infection and transmission. In the current pandemic situation, the medical industry 
      is looking for new technologies to monitor and control the spread of COVID-19. In 
      this context, the current review article highlights the Artificial Intelligence 
      methods that are playing an effective role in rapid, accurate and early diagnosis of 
      the disease via pattern recognition, machine learning, expert system and fuzzy logic 
      by improving cognitive behavior and reducing human error. Auto-encoder deep learning 
      method, α-satellite, ACEMod and heterogeneous graph auto-encoder are AI approaches 
      that determine the transfer rate of virus and are helpful in shaping public health 
      and planning. In addition, CT scan, X-ray, MRI, and RT-PCR are some of the 
      techniques that are being employed in the identification of COVID-19. We hope using 
      AI techniques, the world can emerge from COVID-19 pandemic while mitigating social 
      and economic crisis.

TI  - Distress and rumor exposure on social media during a campus lockdown.
PG  - 11663-11668
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1708518114 [doi]
AB  - During crisis events, people often seek out event-related information to stay 
      informed of what is happening. However, when information from official channels is 
      lacking or disseminated irregularly, people may be at risk for exposure to rumors 
      that fill the information void. We studied information-seeking during a university 
      lockdown following an active-shooter event. In study 1, students in the lockdown (n 
      = 3,890) completed anonymous surveys 1 week later. Those who indicated receiving 
      conflicting information about the lockdown reported greater acute stress 
      [standardized regression coefficient (b) = 0.07; SE = 0.01; 95% confidence interval 
      (CI), 0.04, 0.10]. Additionally, those who reported direct contact with close others 
      via text message (or phone) and used Twitter for critical updates during the 
      lockdown were exposed to more conflicting information. Higher acute stress was 
      reported by heavy social media users who trusted social media for critical updates 
      (b = 0.06, SE = 0.01; 95% CI, 0.03, 0.10). In study 2, we employed a big data 
      approach to explore the time course of rumor transmission across 5 hours surrounding 
      the lockdown within a subset of the university's Twitter followers. We also examined 
      the patterning of distress in the hours during the lockdown as rumors about what was 
      happening (e.g., presence of multiple shooters) spread among Twitter users. During 
      periods without updates from official channels, rumors and distress increased. 
      Results highlight the importance of releasing substantive updates at regular 
      intervals during a crisis event and monitoring social media for rumors to mitigate 
      rumor exposure and distress.

AB  - Early assessment of adverse drug effects in humans is critical to avoid long-lasting 
      harm. However, current approaches for early detection of adverse effects still lack 
      predictive and organ-specific biomarkers to evaluate undesired responses in humans. 
      Microphysiological systems (MPSs) are in vitro representations of human tissues and 
      provide organ-specific translational insights for physiological processes. In this 
      study, a brain MPS was utilized to assess molecular signatures of neurotoxic and 
      non-neurotoxic compounds using targeted and untargeted molecular approaches. The 
      brain MPS comprising of human embryonic stem (ES) cell-derived neural progenitor 
      cells seeded on three-dimensional (3D), chemically defined, polyethylene glycol 
      hydrogels was treated with the neurotoxic drug, bortezomib and the non-neurotoxic 
      drug, tamoxifen over 14-days. Possible toxic effects were monitored with human 
      N-acetylaspartic acid (NAA) kinetics, which correlates the neuronal function/health 
      and DJ-1/PARK7, an oxidative stress biomarker. Changes in NAA levels were observed 
      as early as 2-days post-bortezomib treatment, while onset detection of oxidative 
      stress (DJ-1) was delayed until 4-days post-treatment. Separately, the untargeted 
      extracellular metabolomics approach revealed distinct fingerprints 2-days 
      post-bortezomib treatment as perturbations in cysteine and glycerophospholipid 
      metabolic pathways. These results suggest accumulation of reactive oxygen species 
      associated with oxidative stress, and disruption of membrane structure and 
      integrity. The NAA response was strongly correlated with changes in a subset of the 
      detected metabolites at the same time point 2-days post-treatment. Moreover, these 
      metabolite changes correlated strongly with DJ-1 levels measured at the later time 
      point (4-days post-treatment). This suggests that early cellular metabolic 
      dysfunction leads to later DJ-1 leakage and cell death, and that early measurement 
      of this subset of metabolites could predict the later occurrence of cell death. 
      While the approach demonstrated here provides an individual case study for proof of 
      concept, we suggest that this approach can be extended for preclinical toxicity 
      screening and biomarker discovery studies.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether adding web-based support (e-coachER) to an exercise 
      referral scheme (ERS) increases objectively assessed physical activity (PA). DESIGN: 
      Multicentre trial with participants randomised to usual ERS alone (control) or usual 
      ERS plus e-coachER (intervention). SETTING: Primary care and ERS in three UK sites 
      from 2015 to 2018. PARTICIPANTS: 450 inactive ERS referees with chronic health 
      conditions. INTERVENTIONS: Participants received a pedometer, PA recording sheets 
      and a user guide for the web-based support. e-coachER interactively encouraged the 
      use of the ERS and other PA options. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary and key 
      secondary outcomes were: objective moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) minutes (in 
      ≥10 min bouts and without bouts), respectively, after 12 months. Secondary outcomes 
      were: other accelerometer-derived and self-reported PA measures, ERS attendance, 
      EQ-5D-5L, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and beliefs about PA. All outcomes 
      were collected at baseline, 4 and 12 months. Primary analysis was an intention to 
      treat comparison between intervention and control arms at 12-month follow-up. 
      RESULTS: There was no significant effect of the intervention on weekly MVPA at 12 
      months between the groups recorded in ≥10 min bouts (mean difference 11.8 min of 
      MVPA, 95% CI: -2.1 to 26.0; p=0.10) or without bouts (mean difference 13.7 min of 
      MVPA, 95% CI: -26.8 to 54.2; p=0.51) for 232 participants with usable data. There 
      was no difference in the primary or secondary PA outcomes at 4 or 12 months. 
      CONCLUSION: Augmenting ERS referrals with web-based behavioural support had only a 
      weak, non-significant effect on MVPA. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN15644451.

AB  - To track online emotional expressions on social media platforms close to real-time 
      during the COVID-19 pandemic, we built a self-updating monitor of emotion dynamics 
      using digital traces from three different data sources in Austria. This allows 
      decision makers and the interested public to assess dynamics of sentiment online 
      during the pandemic. We used web scraping and API access to retrieve data from the 
      news platform derstandard.at, Twitter, and a chat platform for students. We 
      documented the technical details of our workflow to provide materials for other 
      researchers interested in building a similar tool for different contexts. Automated 
      text analysis allowed us to highlight changes of language use during COVID-19 in 
      comparison to a neutral baseline. We used special word clouds to visualize that 
      overall difference. Longitudinally, our time series showed spikes in anxiety that 
      can be linked to several events and media reporting. Additionally, we found a marked 
      decrease in anger. The changes lasted for remarkably long periods of time (up to 12 
      weeks). We have also discussed these and more patterns and connect them to the 
      emergence of collective emotions. The interactive dashboard showcasing our data is 
      available online at http://www.mpellert.at/covid19_monitor_austria/. Our work is 
      part of a web archive of resources on COVID-19 collected by the Austrian National 
      Library.

TI  - A cross-sectional study exploring levels of physical activity and motivators and 
      barriers towards physical activity in haemodialysis patients to inform intervention 
      development.
PG  - 1-7
LID - 10.1080/09638288.2019.1672214 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: To describe physical activity (PA) levels and motivators and barriers to PA 
      amongst haemodialysis (HD) patients and to identify an appropriate approach to 
      increasing their PA. Methods: A cross-sectional mixed methods study conducted in a 
      tertiary and satellite HD unit. One hundred and one participants aged 18 years and 
      over, receiving regular HD for at least four months, were recruited. Patients with 
      recent hospital admission or acute cardiac event were excluded. Participants 
      completed health status (EQ-5D-3L™) and activity (Human Activity Profile (HAP)) 
      questionnaires. A subgroup was invited to wear accelerometers and wearable cameras 
      to measure PA levels and capture PA episodes, to inform subsequent semi-structured 
      interviews on motivators and barriers. Semi-structured interviews were analysed 
      using the framework method informed by constructs of the Health Belief Model. 
      Results: 98/101 completed the study (66 males, 32 females). For 68/98 participants, 
      adjusted activity scores from the HAP indicated "impaired" levels of PA; for 67/98 
      participants, the EQ-5D-3L indicated problems with mobility. Semi-structured 
      interviews identified general (fear of falls, pain) and disease specific barriers 
      (fatigue) to PA. Motivators included tailored exercise programmes and educational 
      support from health care professionals. Conclusions: Participants indicated a need 
      for co-development with healthcare professionals of differentiated, targeted 
      exercise interventions. Implications for rehabilitation Healthcare professionals 
      should encourage and motivate haemodialysis patients to participate in physical 
      activity (PA). As part of this approach, there is a need to increase patient 
      knowledge of safe beneficial exercise activities and help individuals identify and 
      overcome barriers. To allow for individualised approaches, clinical interventions 
      should focus on other community activities that patients can do outside the dialysis 
      clinic setting and utilise existing networks such as the British Renal Society 
      Rehabilitation Network. The dialysis clinic provides professionals the opportunity 
      to monitor and motivate patients. Relevant education is needed for staff about the 
      benefits of PA and how to engage patients and their carers in safe and effective 
      approaches.

TI  - MEMS sensor array-based electronic nose for breath analysis-a simulation study.
PG  - 016003
LID - 10.1088/1752-7163/aad5f1 [doi]
AB  - The paper presents a simulation study of breath analysis based on theoretical models 
      of microelectromechanical structure (MEMS) cantilever sensor array. The purpose of 
      this study is to suggest a methodology for the development of MEMS electronic nose 
      (e-nose) for monitoring disease-specific volatiles in exhaled breath. Oxidative 
      stress and diabetes are taken as case studies for the assessment of e-nose designs. 
      The detection of ethane for general oxidative stress, isoprene for hypoxia, and 
      acetone for diabetes are considered for targeted detection. A number of volatiles 
      concurrently present in the exhaled breath are taken as interferents. The MEMS 
      cantilevers are coated with volatile-selective polymers and are analyzed in both the 
      static and dynamic modes. The sensor array is defined by polymer selections based on 
      three data mining methods: principal component analysis (PCA), fuzzy c-means 
      clustering (FCM), and fuzzy subtractive clustering (FSC). This utilizes 
      vapor/polymer partition coefficients as a database. Analyses are carried out to find 
      optimal combinations of the polymer selection method and cantilever sensing mode. 
      Virtual breath analysis experiments are analyzed by PCA for target discrimination. 
      It is found that no single combination works best in all conditions. The acetone 
      (diabetes) detection is best in both sensing modes with the polymers selected by 
      FSC; the isoprene (hypoxia) is detectable only in static sensing mode with polymers 
      selected by FCM clustering; and the ethane (oxidative stress) detection is possible 
      by all sensing modes and polymer selections, provided the breath samples are 
      preconcentrated. This study suggests that it is difficult to realize a single 
      general-purpose MEMS breath analyzer. The dedicated analyzers for specific disease 
      indications can however be made with an optimal combination of sensing mode and 
      polymer coatings.

TI  - Advancement of the German version of the moral distress scale for acute care 
      nurses-A mixed methods study.
PG  - 251-266
LID - 10.1002/nop2.91 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Moral distress experienced by nurses in acute care hospitals can adversely 
      impact the affected nurses, their patients and their hospitals; therefore, it is 
      advisable for organizations to establish internal monitoring of moral distress. 
      However, until now, no suitable questionnaire has been available for use in 
      German-speaking contexts. Hence, the aim of this study was to develop and 
      psychometrically test a German-language version of the Moral Distress Scale. DESIGN: 
      We chose a sequential explanatory mixed methods design, followed by a second 
      quantitative cross-sectional survey. METHODS: An American moral distress scale was 
      chosen, translated, culturally adapted, tested in a pilot study and subsequently 
      used in 2011 to conduct an initial web-based quantitative cross-sectional survey of 
      nurses in all inpatient units at five hospitals in Switzerland's German-speaking 
      region. Data were analysed descriptively and via a Rasch analysis. In 2012, four 
      focus group interviews were conducted with 26 nurses and then evaluated using 
      knowledge maps. The results were used to improve the questionnaire. In 2015, using 
      the revised German-language instrument, a second survey and Rasch analysis were 
      conducted. RESULTS: The descriptive results of the first survey's participants 
      (n = 2153; response rate: 44%) indicated that moral distress is a salient phenomenon 
      in Switzerland. The data from the focus group interviews and the Rasch analysis 
      produced information valuable for the questionnaire's further development. Alongside 
      the data from the second survey's participants (n = 1965; response rate: 40%), the 
      Rasch analysis confirmed the elimination of previous deficiencies on its 
      psychometrics. A Rasch-scaled German version of the Moral Distress Scale is now 
      available for use.

TI  - Assessment of occupational exposure to heat stress and solar ultraviolet radiation 
      among groundskeepers in an eastern North Carolina university setting.
PG  - 105-116
LID - 10.1080/15459624.2017.1392530 [doi]
AB  - Groundskeepers spend most of the year working outdoors, exposing them to heat and 
      solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation and increasing their risk to related adverse health 
      effects. Various studies on heat and UV exposures in different occupations have been 
      published, but those on groundskeepers are rare. The purpose of this study was to 
      assess the exposure to heat stress and solar UV radiation among groundskeepers in an 
      eastern North Carolina university setting. Wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) index 
      using a heat stress monitor and UV effective irradiance (UV(eff)) index using a 
      digital UV meter were recorded in various work areas three times a day (morning, 
      noon, afternoon) and during three seasons (spring, summer, fall). Data analysis was 
      conducted using descriptive statistics, analysis of variance (ANOVA), Tukey Honestly 
      Significant Difference (HSD), and Pearson Correlation tests. The mean (±SD) WBGT 
      index was the highest in the afternoon (25.4 ± 5.0°C), summer (27.8 ± 3.1°C), and 
      July (29.0 ± 2.6°C); the mean UV(eff) index was the highest at noon, summer and June 
      (0.0116 ± 0.0061, 0.0101 ± 0.0081, and 0.0114 ± 0.0089 mW/cm(2), respectively). 
      Differences in the mean WBGT and UV(eff) indices within the time periods of day, 
      seasons and months were significant (P < 0.01). The overall correlation between WBGT 
      and UV indices was moderate (r = 0.42, P < 0.01) but lack of correlation was found 
      during different times of the day during the fall and summer seasons. The largest 
      percentages of WBGT indices exceeding the American Conference of Governmental 
      Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) threshold limit values (TLVs) for different workloads 
      were found in the afternoon (11.3-40.7%), summer (14.6-56%), and July (28.8-76.3%). 
      The mean UV(eff) for noon (0.0116 mW/cm(2)) and afternoon (0.0100 mW/cm(2)) exceeded 
      the TLV for 30-min exposure. This study shows that groundskeepers are potentially 
      exposed to excessive heat stress and UV radiation, and are at risk to developing 
      heat- and UV-related illnesses. The study findings will be beneficial in 
      implementing recommended control measures to prevent heat stress and UV exposure 
      among groundskeepers and other similar outdoor workers.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Dentistry is known to be a challenging degree and students are often 
      under considerable academic pressure which may lead to stress and difficulties in 
      coping. Personality influences coping ability, yet very little is known about the 
      personality traits of dentistry students. This study aimed to describe the 
      personality profiles of students enrolled in an Australian undergraduate dental 
      degree. METHODS: Students enrolled in year one and two of the undergraduate dental 
      programme at The University of Queensland were invited to complete an online survey 
      which included the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI). Personality was 
      measured by four dimensions of temperament: Novelty Seeking, Harm Avoidance, Reward 
      Dependence and Persistence; and three-character traits: Self-Directedness, 
      Cooperativeness and Self-Transcendence. Data analysis was mostly descriptive, and t 
      tests and univariate statistics compared groups. RESULTS: Participants (n = 134; 97% 
      response rate; females = 51%) were generally single, spoke another language at home 
      and lived in shared accommodation. The majority (55%) were 20-29 years old, and 40% 
      were international students. The sample had average levels of all TCI traits, except 
      for Cooperativeness which was high. CONCLUSIONS: This sample of dentistry students 
      portrayed a profile of temperament and character similar to profiles of other health 
      profession students with the intellectual ability and drives to undertake a 
      competitive and challenging degree. Longitudinal studies are needed to track changes 
      in personality throughout the degree. This would provide insight into how and when 
      to best support students.

TI  - Reduction of false arrhythmia alarms using signal selection and machine learning.
PG  - 1204-16
LID - 10.1088/0967-3334/37/8/1204 [doi]
AB  - In this paper, we propose an algorithm that classifies whether a generated cardiac 
      arrhythmia alarm is true or false. The large number of false alarms in intensive 
      care is a severe issue. The noise peaks caused by alarms can be high and in a noisy 
      environment nurses can experience stress and fatigue. In addition, patient safety is 
      compromised because reaction time of the caregivers to true alarms is reduced. The 
      data for the algorithm development consisted of records of electrocardiogram (ECG), 
      arterial blood pressure, and photoplethysmogram signals in which an alarm for either 
      asystole, extreme bradycardia, extreme tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation or 
      flutter, or ventricular tachycardia occurs. First, heart beats are extracted from 
      every signal. Next, the algorithm selects the most reliable signal pair from the 
      available signals by comparing how well the detected beats match between different 
      signals based on [Formula: see text]-score and selecting the best match. From the 
      selected signal pair, arrhythmia specific features, such as heart rate features and 
      signal purity index are computed for the alarm classification. The classification is 
      performed with five separate Random Forest models. In addition, information on the 
      local noise level of the selected ECG lead is added to the classification. The 
      algorithm was trained and evaluated with the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology 
      Challenge 2015 data set. In the test set the overall true positive rates were 93 and 
      95% and true negative rates 80 and 83%, respectively for events with no information 
      and events with information after the alarm. The overall challenge scores were 77.39 
      and 81.58.

TI  - Development of an overactive bladder assessment tool (BAT): A potential improvement 
      to the standard bladder diary.
PG  - 1701-1710
LID - 10.1002/nau.23479 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To develop a comprehensive patient-reported bladder assessment tool (BAT) for 
      assessing overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms, bother, impacts, and satisfaction with 
      treatment. METHODS: Subjects were consented and eligibility was confirmed by a 
      recruiting physician; subjects were then scheduled for in-person interviews. For 
      concept elicitation and cognitive interviews, 30 and 20 subjects, respectively, were 
      targeted for recruitment from US sites. All interviews were conducted face-to-face, 
      audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, anonymized, and analyzed using a qualitative 
      data analysis software program. A draft BAT was created based on the results of the 
      concept elicitation interviews and further revised based on cognitive interviews as 
      well as feedback from an advisory board of clinical and patient-reported outcome 
      (PRO) experts. RESULTS: Nocturia, daytime frequency, and urgency were reported by 
      all subjects (n = 30, 100.0%), and incontinence was reported by most subjects 
      (n = 25, 83.3%). The most frequently reported impacts were waking up to urinate 
      (n = 30, 100.0%), embarrassment/shame (n = 24, 80.0%), stress/anxiety (n = 23, 
      76.7%), and lack of control (n = 23, 76.7%). Following analysis, item generation, 
      cognitive interviews, and advisory board feedback, the resulting BAT contains four 
      hypothesized domains (symptom frequency, symptom bother, impacts, and satisfaction 
      with treatment) and 17 items with a 7-day recall period. CONCLUSIONS: The BAT has 
      been developed in multiple stages with input from both OAB patients and clinical 
      experts following the recommended processes included in the FDA PRO Guidance for 
      Industry. Once fully validated, we believe it will offer a superior alternative to 
      use of the bladder diary and other PROs for monitoring OAB patients in clinical 
      trials and clinical practice.

PG  - 92
LID - 10.3389/fnagi.2017.00092 [doi]
LID - 92
AB  - Contrary to the known benefits from a moderate dietary reduction during adulthood on 
      life span and health, maternal nutrient reduction during pregnancy is supposed to 
      affect the developing brain, probably resulting in impaired brain structure and 
      function throughout life. Decreased fetal nutrition delivery is widespread in both 
      developing and developed countries, caused by poverty and natural disasters, but 
      also due to maternal dieting, teenage pregnancy, pregnancy in women over 35 years of 
      age, placental insufficiency, or multiples. Compromised development of fetal 
      cerebral structures was already shown in our baboon model of moderate maternal 
      nutrient reduction. The present study was designed to follow-up and evaluate the 
      effects of moderate maternal nutrient reduction on individual brain aging in the 
      baboon during young adulthood (4-7 years; human equivalent 14-24 years), applying a 
      novel, non-invasive neuroimaging aging biomarker. The study reveals premature brain 
      aging of +2.7 years (p < 0.01) in the female baboon exposed to fetal undernutrition. 
      The effects of moderate maternal nutrient reduction on individual brain aging 
      occurred in the absence of fetal growth restriction or marked maternal weight 
      reduction at birth, which stresses the significance of early nutritional conditions 
      in life-long developmental programming. This non-invasive MRI biomarker allows 
      further longitudinal in vivo tracking of individual brain aging trajectories to 
      assess the life-long effects of developmental and environmental influences in 
      programming paradigms, aiding preventive and curative treatments on cerebral atrophy 
      in experimental animal models and humans.

AB  - There is a critical need for fast, inexpensive, objective, and accurate screening 
      tools for childhood psychopathology. Perhaps most compelling is in the case of 
      internalizing disorders, like anxiety and depression, where unobservable symptoms 
      cause children to go unassessed-suffering in silence because they never exhibiting 
      the disruptive behaviors that would lead to a referral for diagnostic assessment. If 
      left untreated these disorders are associated with long-term negative outcomes 
      including substance abuse and increased risk for suicide. This paper presents a new 
      approach for identifying children with internalizing disorders using an instrumented 
      90-second mood induction task. Participant motion during the task is monitored using 
      a commercially available wearable sensor. We show that machine learning can be used 
      to differentiate children with an internalizing diagnosis from controls with 81% 
      accuracy (67% sensitivity, 88% specificity). We provide a detailed description of 
      the modeling methodology used to arrive at these results and explore further the 
      predictive ability of each temporal phase of the mood induction task. Kinematical 
      measures most discriminative of internalizing diagnosis are analyzed in detail, 
      showing affected children exhibit significantly more avoidance of ambiguous threat. 
      Performance of the proposed approach is compared to clinical thresholds on 
      parent-reported child symptoms which differentiate children with an internalizing 
      diagnosis from controls with slightly lower accuracy (.68-.75 vs. .81), slightly 
      higher specificity (.88-1.00 vs. .88), and lower sensitivity (.00-.42 vs. .67) than 
      the proposed, instrumented method. These results point toward the future use of this 
      approach for screening children for internalizing disorders so that interventions 
      can be deployed when they have the highest chance for long-term success.

AB  - Background: New technologies may profoundly change our way of understanding 
      psychiatric disorders including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Imaging and 
      biomarkers, along with technological and medical informatics developments, might 
      provide an answer regarding at-risk patient's identification. Recent advances in the 
      concept of 'digital phenotype', which refers to the capture of characteristics of a 
      psychiatric disorder by computerized measurement tools, is one paradigmatic example. 
      Objective: The impact of the new technologies on health professionals practice in 
      PTSD care remains to be determined. The recent evolutions could disrupt the clinical 
      practices and practitioners in their beliefs, ethics and representations, going as 
      far as questioning their professional culture. In the present paper, we conducted an 
      extensive search to highlight the articles which reflect the potential of these new 
      technologies. Method: We conducted an overview by querying PubMed database with the 
      terms [PTSD] [Posttraumatic stress disorder] AND [Computer] OR [Computerized] OR 
      [Mobile] OR [Automatic] OR [Automated] OR [Machine learning] OR [Sensor] OR [Heart 
      rate variability] OR [HRV] OR [actigraphy] OR [actimetry] OR [digital] OR [motion] 
      OR [temperature] OR [virtual reality]. Results: We summarized the synthesized 
      literature in two categories: prediction and assessment (including diagnostic, 
      screening and monitoring). Two independent reviewers screened, extracted data and 
      quality appraised the sources. Results were synthesized narratively. Conclusions: 
      This overview shows that many studies are underway allowing researchers to start 
      building a PTSD digital phenotype using passive data obtained by biometric sensors. 
      Active data obtained from Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) could allow 
      clinicians to assess PTSD patients. The place of connected objects, Artificial 
      Intelligence and remote monitoring of patients with psychiatric pathology remains to 
      be defined. These tools must be explained and adapted to the different profiles of 
      physicians and patients. The involvement of patients, caregivers and health 
      professionals is essential to the design and evaluation of these new tools.

TI  - Analytical parameters and vital signs in patients subjected to dental extraction.
PG  - e223-e230
LID - 10.4317/jced.53474 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dental consultation may provoke stress to the patient, especially when a 
      dental surgery is going to be performed, stressful situations can cause a reaction 
      in the sympathetic nervous system that could lead to cardiovascular alterations. 
      Blood pressure and cardiac frequency are used often as an indirect measurement and 
      this parameters combined can serve as good indicators of stress. Objective: Analyze 
      the changes in vital signs and analytical parameters induced by a dental extraction. 
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: 24 healthy patients who required a simple dental extraction 
      underwent to a blood test and motorization of their pre- and post-extraction vital 
      signs before, at 2 and 48 hours after the procedure. Data analysis was performed by 
      means of repeated measures one way ANOVA followed by multiple comparisons 
      Bonferroni's Post-hoc test. RESULTS: The evaluated patients were 13 women and 11 men 
      with an average age of 35.1. Thirteen patients (54.17% of the sample) were smokers 
      and five were regular drinkers (20.8%). No significant differences were observed in 
      the vital signs with the exception of diastolic blood pressure and cardiac rate that 
      were slightly lower after extraction. Only two analytical parameters showed 
      statistical significant changes. Total bilirubin was significantly higher at 48 
      hours after extraction and leukocyte count was significantly lower at this time. In 
      any case, the magnitude of the changes observed was very low. The analytical 
      parameters and the vital signs did not show any relevant change. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Eventual alterations found after simple tooth extraction should not be attributed to 
      the procedure. Key words:Blood pressure, heart rate, monitoring physiologic, oxygen 
      saturation, tooth extraction.

TI  - fMRI Revealed Reduced Amygdala Activation after Nx4 in Mildly to Moderately Stressed 
      Healthy Volunteers in a Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Cross-Over Trial.

AB  - Social stress contributes to major societal health burdens, such as anxiety 
      disorders and nervousness. Nx4 has been found to modulate stress responses. We 
      investigated whether dampening of such responses is associated with neuronal 
      correlates in brain regions involved in stress and anxiety. In a randomized, 
      placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over trial, 39 healthy males took a single 
      dose (three tablets) of either placebo or Nx4, 40 to 60 minutes before an fMRI scan 
      session. We here report on drug effects on amygdala responses during a face-matching 
      task, which was performed during a complex test battery further including 
      resting-state brain connectivity and a social stress experiment. The first of the 
      Primary Outcomes, defined in a hierarchical order, concerned reduced amygdala 
      effects after intake of verum compared to placebo. We found a statistically 
      significant reduction in differential activations in the left amygdala for the 
      contrast negative faces versus forms during verum versus placebo condition. Our 
      results indicate that effects of Nx4 can be monitored in the brain. Previously noted 
      effects on stress responses may thus be modulated by affective brain regions 
      including the amygdala.

AB  - Apnea of prematurity is a common disorder of respiratory control among preterm 
      infants, with potentially serious adverse consequences on infant development. We 
      review the capability for automatically assessing apnea risk and predicting apnea 
      episodes from multimodal physiological measurements, and for using this knowledge to 
      provide timely therapeutic intervention. We also review other, similar clinical 
      domains of respiratory distress assessment and prediction in the hope of gaining 
      useful insights. We propose an algorithmic framework for constructing discriminative 
      feature vectors from physiological measurements, and for building robust and 
      effective statistical models for apnea assessment and prediction.

LID - e0227712
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are global public health problems. In 
      its severe form it may cause hospital admission, morbidity and mortality. Early 
      reporting of suspected ADRs to regulatory authorities is known to be appropriate 
      measure toinsure health and safety of public form such adverse drug reaction of 
      drugs. In Addis Ababa, there is limited information on ADR reporting practices among 
      medical doctors. Hence, this study aimed to assess ADR reporting practices and 
      associated factors among doctors in government hospitals in Addis Ababa. METHODS: An 
      institution based cross-sectional mixed-methods study design was used. Data 
      werecollected from 407 doctors using self-administered questionnaire and five key 
      informants using semi-structured questionnaire from October 01 to December 31, 2017. 
      Binary logistic regression and thematic analysis methods for quantitative and 
      qualitative data analysis were used respectively. RESULTS: Only 94(27.4%) of doctors 
      had ever reported ADRs to national pharmacovigilance center. The study showed that 
      sex (AOR = 3.51, 95% CI: 1.76-7.03), level ofeducation (AOR = 5.01, 95% CI: 
      2.23-11.28), work experience (AOR = 4.59, 95% CI: 1.21-17.40), existence of ADR 
      reporting form (AOR = 3.96, 95% CI: 1.07-14.61) and reporting to respective 
      marketing authorization holders (AOR = 21.41, 95% CI: 5.89-77.88) were significantly 
      associated with ADR reporting practices. Poor awareness and training on risk of 
      under-reporting, feeling that reporting is minor, absence of appropriate reporting 
      tools, delay and/or absence of feedback on reported ADRs, overly burdened doctors, 
      negligence, fear of legal liabilityand communication gap were cited by key 
      informants as barriers for reporting practice. CONCLUSIONS: Adverse drug reaction 
      reporting practice among doctors wasfound to be low. Sex, level of education, work 
      experience, existence of reporting form and reporting to marketing authorization 
      holderswere significantly associated with ADR reporting practice. In addition, there 
      are gaps in availabilities of guidelines, reporting systems and structure, 
      pre-service and in-service training, and awareness of doctors on impact of 
      reporting. Hence, improving access to ADR reporting form, decentralize safety 
      monitoring system, and conducting awareness training on ADR reporting are essential 
      to improve the ADR reporting practice.

      Agitated persons with dementia can harm themselves, their caregivers, or other 
      patients in a care facility. Automatic detection of agitation would be useful to 
      alert caregivers so that appropriate interventions can be performed. The building 
      blocks in the automatic detection of agitation and aggression are appropriate 
      sensing platforms and generalized predictive models. In this article, we perform a 
      systematic review of studies that use different types of sensors to detect agitation 
      and aggression in persons with dementia. We conclude that actigraphy shows some 
      evidence of correlation with incidences of agitation and aggression; however, 
      multimodal sensing has not been fully evaluated for this purpose. Based on this 
      systematic review, we provide guidelines and recommendations for future research 
      directions in this field.

TI  - Systematic Poisoning Attacks on and Defenses for Machine Learning in Healthcare.

LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2014.2344095 [doi]
AB  - Machine learning is being used in a wide range of application domains to discover 
      patterns in large datasets. Increasingly, the results of machine learning drive 
      critical decisions in applications related to healthcare and biomedicine. Such 
      health-related applications are often sensitive, and thus, any security breach would 
      be catastrophic. Naturally, the integrity of the results computed by machine 
      learning is of great importance. Recent research has shown that some 
      machine-learning algorithms can be compromised by augmenting their training datasets 
      with malicious data, leading to a new class of attacks called poisoning attacks. 
      Hindrance of a diagnosis may have life-threatening consequences and could cause 
      distrust. On the other hand, not only may a false diagnosis prompt users to distrust 
      the machine-learning algorithm and even abandon the entire system but also such a 
      false positive classification may cause patient distress. In this paper, we present 
      a systematic, algorithm-independent approach for mounting poisoning attacks across a 
      wide range of machine-learning algorithms and healthcare datasets. The proposed 
      attack procedure generates input data, which, when added to the training set, can 
      either cause the results of machine learning to have targeted errors (e.g., increase 
      the likelihood of classification into a specific class), or simply introduce 
      arbitrary errors (incorrect classification). These attacks may be applied to both 
      fixed and evolving datasets. They can be applied even when only statistics of the 
      training dataset are available or, in some cases, even without access to the 
      training dataset, although at a lower efficacy. We establish the effectiveness of 
      the proposed attacks using a suite of six machine-learning algorithms and five 
      healthcare datasets. Finally, we present countermeasures against the proposed 
      generic attacks that are based on tracking and detecting deviations in various 
      accuracy metrics, and benchmark their effectiveness.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Admission to the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) for long-term 
      video-electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring (VEEG) constitutes the gold standard 
      for seizure diagnosis and presurgical evaluation. This study applied the concept of 
      a high-frequency systematic monitoring of psychological states and tested patients' 
      compliance in order to evaluate if its integration in the EMU is feasible and if 
      patients benefit from the graphically underpinned discussion of their EMU 
      stay-related cognitions and emotions. METHODS: The process-monitoring is technically 
      realized by an internet-based device for data collection and data analysis, the 
      Synergetic Navigation System (SNS). A convenient sample was enrolled: All eligible 
      patients who were admitted to the EMU of the Department of Neurology, Christian 
      Doppler Medical Center, Salzburg, Austria, between November 6th 2017 and January 
      26th 2018 were approached and recruited upon consent. After a short 
      resource-oriented interview, each enrolled patient was provided with a tablet. The 
      daily questionnaire included eight standardized and up to three personalized items. 
      Self-assessments were collected every 5 h prior to meal times (6:30 am, 11:30 am, 
      and 4:30 pm) and at 9:30 pm. The detailed visualizations of the patients' replies 
      were discussed with the participants during a feedback session at the end of the EMU 
      stay. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients (12 women/9 men, median age 29 years [range 
      18-74 years]) were consecutively recruited (72% of all eligible patients). 
      Compliance rates were high (median: 82%, range 60%-100%) among the respondents. Mood 
      correlated strongly with hopefulness (r = 0.71) and moderately with energy 
      (r = 0.63) in all patients. When correlating the intraindividual medians of the 
      process questionnaire time series with the pretest total scores, energy correlated 
      moderately and negatively with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) (r = -0.45), while 
      self-efficacy correlated moderately and negatively with the Neurological Disorders 
      Depression Inventory for Epilepsy (NDDI-E) total scores in all patients (r = -0.5). 
      Nine patients (43%) reported that they learned something meaningful about themselves 
      after the feedback discussion of their individual time series. CONCLUSION: The 
      results support the feasibility of high-frequency monitoring of psychological states 
      and processes in routine EMU settings. Repeated daily collections four times per day 
      of psychological surveys allow for the assessment of highly resolved, equidistant 
      time series data, which gives insight into psychological states and processes during 
      EMU admission.

TI  - Changes in functional connectivity after theta-burst transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation for post-traumatic stress disorder: a machine-learning study.
PG  - 29-37
LID - 10.1007/s00406-020-01172-5 [doi]
AB  - Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) is a novel treatment approach for 
      post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and recent neuroimaging work indicates that 
      functional connectivity profiles may be able to identify those most likely to 
      respond. However, prior work has relied on functional magnetic resonance imaging, 
      which is expensive and difficult to scale. Alternatively, electroencephalography 
      (EEG) represents a different approach that may be easier to implement in clinical 
      practice. To this end, we acquired an 8-channel resting-state EEG signal on 
      participants before (n = 47) and after (n = 43) randomized controlled trial of iTBS 
      for PTSD (ten sessions, delivered at 80% of motor threshold, 1,800 pulses, to the 
      right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). We used a cross-validated support vector 
      machine (SVM) to track changes in EEG functional connectivity after verum iTBS 
      stimulation. We found that an SVM classifier was able to successfully separate 
      patients who received active treatment vs. sham treatment, with statistically 
      significant findings in the Delta band (1-4 Hz, p = 0.002). Using Delta coherence, 
      the classifier was 75.0% accurate in detecting sham vs. active iTBS, and observed 
      changes represented an increase in functional connectivity between midline 
      central/occipital and a decrease between frontal and central regions. The primary 
      limitations of this work are the sparse electrode system and a modest sample size. 
      Our findings raise the possibility that EEG and machine learning may be combined to 
      provide a window into mechanisms of action of TMS, with the potential that these 
      approaches can inform the development of individualized treatment methods.

AB  - The number of channels used for polysomnographic recording frequently causes 
      difficulties for patients because of the many cables connected. Also, it increases 
      the risk of having troubles during recording process and increases the storage 
      volume. In this study, it is intended to detect periodic leg movement (PLM) in sleep 
      with the use of the channels except leg electromyography (EMG) by analysing 
      polysomnography (PSG) data with digital signal processing (DSP) and machine learning 
      methods. PSG records of 153 patients of different ages and genders with PLM disorder 
      diagnosis were examined retrospectively. A novel software was developed for the 
      analysis of PSG records. The software utilizes the machine learning algorithms, 
      statistical methods, and DSP methods. In order to classify PLM, popular machine 
      learning methods (multilayer perceptron, K-nearest neighbour, and random forests) 
      and logistic regression were used. Comparison of classified results showed that 
      while K-nearest neighbour classification algorithm had higher average classification 
      rate (91.87%) and lower average classification error value (RMSE = 0.2850), 
      multilayer perceptron algorithm had the lowest average classification rate (83.29%) 
      and the highest average classification error value (RMSE = 0.3705). Results showed 
      that PLM can be classified with high accuracy (91.87%) without leg EMG record being 
      present.

TI  - An information-based machine learning approach to elasticity imaging.
PG  - 805-822
LID - 10.1007/s10237-016-0854-6 [doi]
AB  - An information-based technique is described for applications in mechanical property 
      imaging of soft biological media under quasi-static loads. We adapted the 
      Autoprogressive method that was originally developed for civil engineering 
      applications for this purpose. The Autoprogressive method is a computational 
      technique that combines knowledge of object shape and a sparse distribution of force 
      and displacement measurements with finite-element analyses and artificial neural 
      networks to estimate a complete set of stress and strain vectors. Elasticity imaging 
      parameters are then computed from estimated stresses and strains. We introduce the 
      technique using ultrasonic pulse-echo measurements in simple gelatin imaging 
      phantoms having linear-elastic properties so that conventional finite-element 
      modeling can be used to validate results. The Autoprogressive algorithm does not 
      require any assumptions about the material properties and can, in principle, be used 
      to image media with arbitrary properties. We show that by selecting a few 
      well-chosen force-displacement measurements that are appropriately applied during 
      training and establish convergence, we can estimate all nontrivial stress and strain 
      vectors throughout an object and accurately estimate an elastic modulus at high 
      spatial resolution. This new method of modeling the mechanical properties of 
      tissue-like materials introduces a unique method of solving the inverse problem and 
      is the first technique for imaging stress without assuming the underlying 
      constitutive model.

AB  - The challenge of providing services that meet the growing needs of an ageing 
      population is one confronted by communities across Australia and internationally. 
      The aim of this study was to: a) undertake semi-structured interviews and focus 
      groups across a sample of service and technical staff to identify the 
      interconnection between communication, information, work practices and performance; 
      and b) carry out a comprehensive review of existing data sources to identify the 
      data linkages required to identify and monitor performance across different 
      dimensions of the quality of aged care spectrum. The results from this study 
      provided empirical evidence of the interconnection between communication, 
      information, work practices and performance; and highlighted numerous potential data 
      linkages which can be used to monitor performance across different dimensions of 
      aged care. These included: the uptake and utilisation of community care services, 
      community aged care client interactions and transitions (with hospitals and other 
      health care providers), and quality of life measures (e.g., health and safety 
      status, symptoms of depression and anxiety, social integration and mortality rates).

TI  - Partitioning the Sleep Quality and Insomnia Severity among Earthquake Victims in the 
      West of Iran: Cluster Prediction Based on Personality and Psychological Factors.
PG  - e00458
AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to perform a cluster analysis on sleep quality and insomnia 
      severity in addition to predicting the clusters based on personality traits, 
      experiential avoidance, stress, anxiety, depression, and dysfunctional beliefs and 
      attitudes about sleep. STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. METHODS: This study 
      was conducted on earthquake victim in Kermanshah (western Iran) in 2017. Data 
      collection began 15 d after the earthquake and lasted for 2 weeks. First, 1002 
      copies of the questionnaire were distributed and, finally, analyses were performed 
      for 778 individuals. Data analysis was conducted using cluster analysis. RESULTS: 
      Based on sleep quality and insomnia severity, four clusters were formed, and a 
      correlation existed between some personality traits, psychological distress, 
      experiential avoidance, and dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes about sleep with 
      unhealthy clusters (P<0.05). The summary of the model showed the sufficient fit of 
      the model (P<0.0005) and that it could predict 22.8%-42.4% of the variance of 
      unhealthy clusters. CONCLUSION: Dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes about sleep, 
      experiential avoidance, stress, anxiety, depression, and personality traits could 
      contribute to sleep problems and reduce sleep quality in earthquake victims.

TI  - Broadening the Debate About Post-trial Access to Medical Interventions: A 
      Qualitative Study of Participant Experiences at the End of a Trial Investigating a 
      Medical Device to Support Type 1 Diabetes Self-Management.
PG  - 100-112
LID - 10.1080/23294515.2019.1592264 [doi]
AB  - Increasing ethical attention and debate is focusing on whether individuals who take 
      part in clinical trials should be given access to post-trial care. However, the main 
      focus of this debate has been upon drug trials undertaken in low-income settings. To 
      broaden this debate, we report findings from interviews with individuals (n = 24) 
      who participated in a clinical trial of a closed-loop system, which is a medical 
      device under development for people with type 1 diabetes that automatically adjusts 
      blood glucose to help keep it within clinically recommended ranges. Individuals were 
      recruited from UK sites and interviewed following trial close-out, at which point 
      the closed-loop had been withdrawn. While individuals were stoical and accepting of 
      the requirement to return the closed-loop, they also conveyed varying degrees of 
      distress. Many described having relaxed diabetes management practices while using 
      the closed-loop and having become deskilled as a consequence, which made reverting 
      back to pre-trial regimens challenging. Participants also described unanticipated 
      consequences arising from using a closed-loop. As well as deskilling, these included 
      experiencing psychological and emotional benefits that could not be sustained after 
      the closed-loop had been withdrawn and participants reevaluating their pre- and 
      post-trial life in light of having used a closed-loop and now perceiving this life 
      much more negatively. Participants also voiced frustrations about experiencing 
      better blood glucose control using a closed-loop and then having to revert to using 
      what they now saw as antiquated and imprecise self-management tools. We use these 
      findings to argue that ethical debates about post-trial provisioning need to be 
      broadened to consider potential psychological and emotional harms, and not just 
      clinical harms, that may result from withdrawal of investigated treatments. We also 
      suggest that individuals may benefit from information about potential nonclinical 
      harms to help make informed decisions about trial participation.

TI  - Opportunities and challenges in the use of personal health data for health research.
PG  - e42-8
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocv118 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Understand barriers to the use of personal health data (PHD) in research 
      from the perspective of three stakeholder groups: early adopter individuals who 
      track data about their health, researchers who may use PHD as part of their 
      research, and companies that market self-tracking devices, apps or services, and 
      aggregate and manage the data that are generated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A targeted 
      convenience sample of 465 individuals and 134 researchers completed an extensive 
      online survey. Thirty-five hour-long semi-structured qualitative interviews were 
      conducted with a subset of 11 individuals and 9 researchers, as well as 15 
      company/key informants. RESULTS: Challenges to the use of PHD for research were 
      identified in six areas: data ownership; data access for research; privacy; informed 
      consent and ethics; research methods and data quality; and the unpredictable nature 
      of the rapidly evolving ecosystem of devices, apps, and other services that leave 
      "digital footprints." Individuals reported willingness to anonymously share PHD if 
      it would be used to advance research for the good of the public. Researchers were 
      enthusiastic about using PHD for research, but noted barriers related to 
      intellectual property, licensing, and the need for legal agreements with companies. 
      Companies were interested in research but stressed that their first priority was 
      maintaining customer relationships. CONCLUSION: Although challenges exist in 
      leveraging PHD for research, there are many opportunities for stakeholder 
      engagement, and experimentation with these data is already taking place. These early 
      examples foreshadow a much larger set of activities with the potential to positively 
      transform how health research is conducted.

      scores for whole-exome SNV studies.
PG  - e0192829

LID - e0192829
AB  - Many automatic classifiers were introduced to aid inference of phenotypical effects 
      of uncategorised nsSNVs (nonsynonymous Single Nucleotide Variations) in theoretical 
      and medical applications. Lately, several meta-estimators have been proposed that 
      combine different predictors, such as PolyPhen and SIFT, to integrate more 
      information in a single score. Although many advances have been made in feature 
      design and machine learning algorithms used, the shortage of high-quality reference 
      data along with the bias towards intensively studied in vitro models call for 
      improved generalisation ability in order to further increase classification accuracy 
      and handle records with insufficient data. Since a meta-estimator basically combines 
      different scoring systems with highly complicated nonlinear relationships, we 
      investigated how deep learning (supervised and unsupervised), which is particularly 
      efficient at discovering hierarchies of features, can improve classification 
      performance. While it is believed that one should only use deep learning for 
      high-dimensional input spaces and other models (logistic regression, support vector 
      machines, Bayesian classifiers, etc) for simpler inputs, we still believe that the 
      ability of neural networks to discover intricate structure in highly heterogenous 
      datasets can aid a meta-estimator. We compare the performance with various popular 
      predictors, many of which are recommended by the American College of Medical 
      Genetics and Genomics (ACMG), as well as available deep learning-based predictors. 
      Thanks to hardware acceleration we were able to use a computationally expensive 
      genetic algorithm to stochastically optimise hyper-parameters over many generations. 
      Overfitting was hindered by noise injection and dropout, limiting coadaptation of 
      hidden units. Although we stress that this work was not conceived as a tool 
      comparison, but rather an exploration of the possibilities of deep learning 
      application in ensemble scores, our results show that even relatively simple modern 
      neural networks can significantly improve both prediction accuracy and coverage. We 
      provide open-access to our finest model via the web-site:

AB  - Targeted mass spectrometry by selected reaction monitoring (S/MRM) has proven to be 
      a suitable technique for the consistent and reproducible quantification of proteins 
      across multiple biological samples and a wide dynamic range. This performance 
      profile is an important prerequisite for systems biology and biomedical research. 
      However, the method is limited to the measurements of a few hundred peptides per 
      LC-MS analysis. Recently, we introduced SWATH-MS, a combination of data independent 
      acquisition and targeted data analysis that vastly extends the number of 
      peptides/proteins quantified per sample, while maintaining the favorable performance 
      profile of S/MRM. Here we applied the SWATH-MS technique to quantify changes over 
      time in a large fraction of the proteome expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae in 
      response to osmotic stress. We sampled cell cultures in biological triplicates at 
      six time points following the application of osmotic stress and acquired single 
      injection data independent acquisition data sets on a high-resolution 5600 tripleTOF 
      instrument operated in SWATH mode. Proteins were quantified by the targeted 
      extraction and integration of transition signal groups from the SWATH-MS datasets 
      for peptides that are proteotypic for specific yeast proteins. We consistently 
      identified and quantified more than 15,000 peptides and 2500 proteins across the 18 
      samples. We demonstrate high reproducibility between technical and biological 
      replicates across all time points and protein abundances. In addition, we show that 
      the abundance of hundreds of proteins was significantly regulated upon osmotic 
      shock, and pathway enrichment analysis revealed that the proteins reacting to 
      osmotic shock are mainly involved in the carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism. 
      Overall, this study demonstrates the ability of SWATH-MS to efficiently generate 
      reproducible, consistent, and quantitatively accurate measurements of a large 
      fraction of a proteome across multiple samples.

TI  - Predictors of atrial fibrillation early recurrence following cryoballoon ablation of 
      pulmonary veins using statistical assessment and machine learning algorithms.
PG  - 352-359

AB  - Inflammation, oxidative stress, myocardial injury biomarkers and clinical parameters 
      (longer AF duration, left atrial enlargement, the metabolic syndrome) are factors 
      commonly related to AF recurrence. This study aims to assess the predictive value of 
      laboratory and clinical parameters responsible for early recurrence of atrial 
      fibrillation (ERAF) following cryoballoon ablation (CBA) using statistical 
      assessment and machine learning algorithms. This study group comprised 118 
      consecutive patients (mean age, 62.5 ± 7.8 years; women 36%) with paroxysmal (54.1%) 
      and persistent (45.9%) AF who underwent their first pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) 
      performed by CBA (Arctic Front Advance 2nd generation 28 mm). The biomarker 
      concentrations were measured at baseline and after CBA in a 24-h follow-up. ERAF was 
      defined as at least a 30-s episode of arrhythmia registered by a 24 h-Holter monitor 
      within the 3 months following the procedure. 56 clinical, laboratory and procedural 
      variables were collected from each patient. We used two classification algorithms: 
      support vector machines, gradient boosted tree. The synthetic minority over-sampling 
      technique (SMOTE) was used to provide a balanced training data set. Within a period 
      of 3 months 21 patients (17.8%) experienced ERAF. The statistical analysis indicated 
      that the lowered levels of post-ablation TnT (p = 0.043) and CK-MB (p = 0.010) with 
      the TnT elevation (p = 0.044) were the predictors of ERAF following CBA. In 
      addition, diabetes and statin treatment were significantly associated with ERAF 
      after CBA (p < 0.05). The machine learning algorithms confirmed the results obtained 
      in the univariate analysis.

      Classification of Mental Stress.

LID - 10.1109/jsen.2018.2872651 [doi]
AB  - Human-computer interaction (HCI) technology, and the automatic classification of a 
      person's mental state, are of interest to multiple industries. In this work, the 
      fusion of sensing modalities that monitor the oxygenation of the human prefrontal 
      cortex (PFC) and cardiovascular physiology was evaluated to differentiate between 
      rest, mental arithmetic and N-back memory tasks. A flexible headband to measure 
      near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) for quantifying PFC oxygenation, and forehead 
      photoplethysmography (PPG) for assessing peripheral cardiovascular activity was 
      designed. Physiological signals such as the electrocardiogram (ECG) and 
      seismocardiogram (SCG) were collected, along with the measurements obtained using 
      the headband. The setup was tested and validated with a total of 16 human subjects 
      performing a series of arithmetic and N-back memory tasks. Features extracted were 
      related to cardiac and peripheral sympathetic activity, vasomotor tone, pulse wave 
      propagation, and oxygenation. Machine learning techniques were utilized to classify 
      rest, arithmetic, and N-back tasks, using leave-one-subject-out cross validation. 
      Macro-averaged accuracy of 85%, precision of 84%, recall rate of 83%, and F1 score 
      of 80% were obtained from the classification of the three states. Statistical 
      analyses on the subject-based results demonstrate that the fusion of NIRS and 
      peripheral cardiovascular sensing significantly improves the accuracy, precision, 
      recall, and F1 scores, compared to using NIRS sensing alone. Moreover, the fusion 
      significantly improves the precision compared to peripheral cardiovascular sensing 
      alone. The results of this work can be used in the future to design a multi-modal 
      wearable sensing system for classifying mental state for applications such as acute 
      stress detection.

TI  - The multi-sectorial emergency response to a cholera outbreak in Internally Displaced 
      Persons camps in Borno State, Nigeria, 2017.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: In August 2017, a cholera outbreak started in Muna Garage Internally 
      Displaced Persons camp, Borno state, Nigeria and >5000 cases occurred in six local 
      government areas. This qualitative study evaluated perspectives about the emergency 
      response to this outbreak. METHODS: We conducted 39 key informant interviews and 
      focus group discussions, and reviewed 21 documents with participants involved with 
      surveillance, water, sanitation, hygiene, case management, oral cholera vaccine 
      (OCV), communications, logistics and coordination. Qualitative data analysis used 
      thematic techniques comprising key words in context, word repetition and key sector 
      terms. RESULTS: Authorities were alerted quickly, but outbreak declaration took 12 
      days due to a 10-day delay waiting for culture confirmation. Outbreak investigation 
      revealed several potential transmission channels, but a leaking latrine around the 
      index cases' house was not repaired for more than 7 days. Chlorine was initially not 
      accepted by the community due to rumours that it would sterilise women. Key messages 
      were in Hausa, although Kanuri was the primary local language; later this was 
      corrected. Planning would have benefited using exercise drills to identify 
      weaknesses, and inventory sharing to avoid stock outs. The response by the Rural 
      Water Supply and Sanitation Agency was perceived to be slow and an increased risk 
      from a religious festival was not recognised. Case management was provided at 
      treatment centres, but some partners were concerned that their work was not 
      recognised asking, 'Who gets the glory and the data?' Nearly one million people 
      received OCV and its distribution benefited from a robust infrastructure for polio 
      vaccination. There was initial anxiety, rumour and reluctance about OCV, attributed 
      by many to lack of formative research prior to vaccine implementation. Coordination 
      was slow initially, but improved with activation of an emergency operations centre 
      (EOC) that enabled implementation of incident management system to coordinate 
      multisectoral activities and meetings held at 16:00 hours daily. The synergy between 
      partners and government improved when each recognised the government's leadership 
      role. CONCLUSION: Despite a timely alert of the outbreak, delayed laboratory 
      confirmation slowed initial response. Initial responses to the outbreak were not 
      well coordinated but improved with the EOC. Understanding behaviours and community 
      norms through rapid formative research should improve the effectiveness of the 
      emergency response to a cholera outbreak. OCV distribution was efficient and 
      benefited from the polio vaccine infrastructure.

AB  - Ground-motion models (GMMs) are a key driver for the results of probabilistic 
      seismic hazard analyses and their uncertainty. GMMs that bridge seismological and 
      empirical approaches are an effective tool to represent the distribution of ground 
      motion and its uncertainty in seismic hazard assessment. A methodology is presented 
      that uses ground-motion data recorded at seismograph sites in eastern North America 
      and shows how they can be used to calibrate simple scalable seismological models of 
      ground-motion generation and propagation. Such GMMs can directly account for the 
      gross features of source scaling (magnitude and stress parameter), attenuation, site 
      response, and kappa effects. It is shown that, by application of appropriate GMM 
      strategies, sigma (aleatory uncertainty) could be greatly reduced, resulting in 
      lower calculated hazard for nuclear plants founded on rock. This reduction in sigma 
      requires that high-quality seismic monitoring (e.g., broadband seismograph stations) 
      be installed and operated over a period of years (in addition to strong-motion 
      stations), and that an ongoing investment be made in data analysis and targeted GMM 
      development using the data.

TI  - Enuretic children have a higher variability in REM sleep when comparing their sleep 
      parameters with nonenuretic control children using a wearable sleep tracker at home.
PG  - 367-375

AB  - PURPOSE: That children with nocturnal enuresis ("bedwetting") are deep sleepers is a 
      fact that their parents often state when asking for advice. However, until today no 
      clear difference in sleep has been observed between children who do and do not wet 
      the bed. This study investigates the difference in sleep parameters and heart rate 
      variability (HRV) between enuretic and control children in their home setting by 
      using a wearable sleep tracker during a long observation period. METHODS: Twenty-one 
      enuretic and 18 control children, aged 6 to 12 years old, slept with a wearable 
      sleep tracker device, a Fitbit Charge 2, for 14 consecutive days. In addition, 
      nocturnal urine production (voided volumes and/or weight of the diaper) were 
      measured. The HRV was calculated using the standard time and frequency domain 
      parameters. The Kruskal-Wallis test was applied to evaluate the differences in the 
      sleep and HRV parameters between both groups. RESULTS: Compared with healthy 
      controls, enuretic children showed a higher standard deviation (P = .0209) of 
      minutes spent in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep among the different nights. In 
      addition, they showed the tendencies to fewer awakenings (P = .1161), although this 
      was not significant. Analyzing the wet nights of the enuretic children, they showed 
      higher autonomic activity, lower sleep efficiency and a higher restlessness compared 
      with their dry nights and to the control group. CONCLUSION: This 2-weeks 
      sleep-study, using a wrist-worn sleep tracker device Fitbit Charge 2, in the normal 
      home environment has shown that enuretic children have a larger variation in their 
      REM sleep and sleepless efficiently during a wet night when compared with 
      non-bedwetting children.

TI  - Development of New Rheological Models for Class G Cement with Nanoclay as an 
      Additive Using Machine Learning Techniques.
PG  - 17646-17657

AB  - The rheology of the oil well cement plays a pivotal role in the cement placement. 
      Accurate prediction of cement rheological parameters helps to monitor the durability 
      and pumpability of the cement slurry. In this study, an artificial neural network is 
      used to develop different models for the prediction of various rheological 
      parameters such as shear stress, apparent viscosity, plastic viscosity, and yield 
      point of a class G cement slurry with nanoclay as an additive. An extensive 
      experimental study was conducted to generate enough data set for the training of 
      artificial intelligence models. The class G oil well cement slurries were prepared 
      by fixing the water-cement ratio to 0.44 and adding organically modified nanoclays 
      as a strength enhancer. The rheological properties of the oil well cement slurries 
      were investigated at a wide range of temperatures (37 ≤ T ≤ 90 °C) and shear rates 
      (5 ≤ γ ≤ 500 s(-1)). Experimental data generated were used for the training of 
      feed-forward neural networks. The predicted values of the rheological properties 
      from the trained model showed a good agreement when compared with the experimental 
      values. The average absolute percentage error was less than 5% in both training and 
      validation phases of modeling. A trend analysis was carried out to ensure that the 
      proposed models can define the underlying physics. From the validation and the trend 
      analysis, it was found that the new models can be used to predict cement rheological 
      properties within the range of data set on which the models were trained. The 
      proposed models are independent of laboratory-dependent variables and can give quick 
      and real-time values of the rheological parameters.

TI  - Supervised machine learning algorithms to diagnose stress for vehicle drivers based 
      on physiological sensor signals.
PG  - 241-8
AB  - Machine learning algorithms play an important role in computer science research. 
      Recent advancement in sensor data collection in clinical sciences lead to a complex, 
      heterogeneous data processing, and analysis for patient diagnosis and prognosis. 
      Diagnosis and treatment of patients based on manual analysis of these sensor data 
      are difficult and time consuming. Therefore, development of Knowledge-based systems 
      to support clinicians in decision-making is important. However, it is necessary to 
      perform experimental work to compare performances of different machine learning 
      methods to help to select appropriate method for a specific characteristic of data 
      sets. This paper compares classification performance of three popular machine 
      learning methods i.e., case-based reasoning, neutral networks and support vector 
      machine to diagnose stress of vehicle drivers using finger temperature and heart 
      rate variability. The experimental results show that case-based reasoning 
      outperforms other two methods in terms of classification accuracy. Case-based 
      reasoning has achieved 80% and 86% accuracy to classify stress using finger 
      temperature and heart rate variability. On contrary, both neural network and support 
      vector machine have achieved less than 80% accuracy by using both physiological 
      signals.

TI  - Multivariate Brain Prediction of Heart Rate and Skin Conductance Responses to Social 
      Threat.
PG  - 11987-11998
AB  - Psychosocial stressors induce autonomic nervous system (ANS) responses in multiple 
      body systems that are linked to health risks. Much work has focused on the common 
      effects of stress, but ANS responses in different body systems are dissociable and 
      may result from distinct patterns of cortical-subcortical interactions. Here, we 
      used machine learning to develop multivariate patterns of fMRI activity predictive 
      of heart rate (HR) and skin conductance level (SCL) responses during social threat 
      in humans (N = 18). Overall, brain patterns predicted both HR and SCL in 
      cross-validated analyses successfully (r(HR) = 0.54, r(SCL) = 0.58, both p < 
      0.0001). These patterns partly reflected central stress mechanisms common to both 
      responses because each pattern predicted the other signal to some degree (r(HR→SCL) 
      = 0.21 and r(SCL→HR) = 0.22, both p < 0.01), but they were largely physiological 
      response specific. Both patterns included positive predictive weights in dorsal 
      anterior cingulate and cerebellum and negative weights in ventromedial PFC and local 
      pattern similarity analyses within these regions suggested that they encode common 
      central stress mechanisms. However, the predictive maps and searchlight analysis 
      suggested that the patterns predictive of HR and SCL were substantially different 
      across most of the brain, including significant differences in ventromedial PFC, 
      insula, lateral PFC, pre-SMA, and dmPFC. Overall, the results indicate that specific 
      patterns of cerebral activity track threat-induced autonomic responses in specific 
      body systems. Physiological measures of threat are not interchangeable, but rather 
      reflect specific interactions among brain systems. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: We show 
      that threat-induced increases in heart rate and skin conductance share some common 
      representations in the brain, located mainly in the vmPFC, temporal and 
      parahippocampal cortices, thalamus, and brainstem. However, despite these 
      similarities, the brain patterns that predict these two autonomic responses are 
      largely distinct. This evidence for largely output-measure-specific regulation of 
      autonomic responses argues against a common system hypothesis and provides evidence 
      that different autonomic measures reflect distinct, measurable patterns of 
      cortical-subcortical interactions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: As one of the serious public health issues, vaccination refusal has been 
      attracting more and more attention, especially for newly approved human 
      papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines. Understanding public opinion towards HPV vaccines, 
      especially concerns on social media, is of significant importance for HPV 
      vaccination promotion. METHODS: In this study, we leveraged a hierarchical machine 
      learning based sentiment analysis system to extract public opinions towards HPV 
      vaccines from Twitter. English tweets containing HPV vaccines-related keywords were 
      collected from November 2, 2015 to March 28, 2016. Manual annotation was done to 
      evaluate the performance of the system on the unannotated tweets corpus. Followed 
      time series analysis was applied to this corpus to track the trends of 
      machine-deduced sentiments and their associations with different days of the week. 
      RESULTS: The evaluation of the unannotated tweets corpus showed that the 
      micro-averaging F scores have reached 0.786. The learning system deduced the 
      sentiment labels for 184,214 tweets in the collected unannotated tweets corpus. Time 
      series analysis identified a coincidence between mainstream outcome and Twitter 
      contents. A weak trend was found for "Negative" tweets that decreased firstly and 
      began to increase later; an opposite trend was identified for "Positive" tweets. 
      Tweets that contain the worries on efficacy for HPV vaccines showed a relative 
      significant decreasing trend. Strong associations were found between some sentiments 
      ("Positive", "Negative", "Negative-Safety" and "Negative-Others") with different 
      days of the week. CONCLUSIONS: Our efforts on sentiment analysis for newly approved 
      HPV vaccines provide us an automatic and instant way to extract public opinion and 
      understand the concerns on Twitter. Our approaches can provide a feedback to public 
      health professionals to monitor online public response, examine the effectiveness of 
      their HPV vaccination promotion strategies and adjust their promotion plans.

TI  - ADReCS-Target: target profiles for aiding drug safety research and application.

LID - 10.1093/nar/gkx899 [doi]
AB  - Delivering safe and effective therapeutic treatment to patients is one of the grand 
      challenges in modern medicine. However, drug safety research has been progressing 
      slowly in recent years, compared to other fields such as biotechnologies and 
      precision medicine, due to the mechanistic complexity of adverse drug reactions 
      (ADRs). To fill up this gap, we develop a new database, the Adverse Drug Reaction 
      Classification System-Target Profile (ADReCS-Target, 
      http://bioinf.xmu.edu.cn/ADReCS-Target), which provides comprehensive information 
      about ADRs caused by drug interaction with protein, gene and genetic variation. In 
      total, ADReCS-Target includes 66,573 pairwise relations, among which 1710 are 
      protein-ADR associations, 2613 are genetic variation-ADR associations, and 63,298 
      are gene-ADR associations. In a case study of exploring the mechanism of rash, we 
      find that HLAs, C1QA and APOA1 are the key gene players and thus can be potential 
      targets (or biomarkers) in monitoring or countermining rashes. In summary, 
      ADReCS-Target can be a useful resource for the biomedical scientific community by 
      serving researchers in the fields of drug development, clinical pharmacology, 
      precision medicine, and from web lab to high-throughput computational platform. 
      Particularly, it helps to identify drug with better ADR profile and design safer 
      drug therapy regimen.

TI  - Understanding Depressive Symptoms and Psychosocial Stressors on Twitter: A 
      Corpus-Based Study.
PG  - e48
LID - 10.2196/jmir.6895 [doi]
LID - e48
AB  - BACKGROUND: With a lifetime prevalence of 16.2%, major depressive disorder is the 
      fifth biggest contributor to the disease burden in the United States. OBJECTIVE: The 
      aim of this study, building on previous work qualitatively analyzing 
      depression-related Twitter data, was to describe the development of a comprehensive 
      annotation scheme (ie, coding scheme) for manually annotating Twitter data with 
      Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Edition 5 (DSM 5) major 
      depressive symptoms (eg, depressed mood, weight change, psychomotor agitation, or 
      retardation) and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Edition IV 
      (DSM-IV) psychosocial stressors (eg, educational problems, problems with primary 
      support group, housing problems). METHODS: Using this annotation scheme, we 
      developed an annotated corpus, Depressive Symptom and Psychosocial Stressors 
      Acquired Depression, the SAD corpus, consisting of 9300 tweets randomly sampled from 
      the Twitter application programming interface (API) using depression-related 
      keywords (eg, depressed, gloomy, grief). An analysis of our annotated corpus yielded 
      several key results. RESULTS: First, 72.09% (6829/9473) of tweets containing 
      relevant keywords were nonindicative of depressive symptoms (eg, "we're in for a new 
      economic depression"). Second, the most prevalent symptoms in our dataset were 
      depressed mood and fatigue or loss of energy. Third, less than 2% of tweets 
      contained more than one depression related category (eg, diminished ability to think 
      or concentrate, depressed mood). Finally, we found very high positive correlations 
      between some depression-related symptoms in our annotated dataset (eg, fatigue or 
      loss of energy and educational problems; educational problems and diminished ability 
      to think). CONCLUSIONS: We successfully developed an annotation scheme and an 
      annotated corpus, the SAD corpus, consisting of 9300 tweets randomly-selected from 
      the Twitter application programming interface using depression-related keywords. Our 
      analyses suggest that keyword queries alone might not be suitable for public health 
      monitoring because context can change the meaning of keyword in a statement. 
      However, postprocessing approaches could be useful for reducing the noise and 
      improving the signal needed to detect depression symptoms using social media.

TI  - General Anxiety in Dental Staff and Hemodynamic Changes over Endodontists' Workday 
      during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic: A Prospective Longitudinal Study.
PG  - 196-203

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to assess general anxiety levels in 
      endodontists and dental assistants related to different conditions during the 
      pandemic and lockdown and to evaluate hemodynamic changes in endodontists' heart 
      rate (HR), blood pressure, and blood oxygenation during their workday. METHODS: 
      Anxiety levels in endodontists and dental assistants were recorded weekly during the 
      state of alarm declared because of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. 
      Hemodynamic parameters were monitored using a sphygmomanometer for HR and blood 
      pressure and a pulse oximeter for oxygen saturation. Measurements were taken before 
      and after each root canal treatment as well as on arrival at the clinic and at the 
      end of the working day. Rest data, recorded every Saturday, served as a control. 
      Data analysis was performed using chi-square, paired t, Mann-Whitney, and analysis 
      of variance tests (P < .05). RESULTS: General anxiety decreased over the weeks, with 
      significant differences between weeks 1 and 4 (P < .05). Endodontists perceived 
      higher anxiety levels of anxiety during anesthesia inoculation and dental assistants 
      during the dental unit's disinfection and equipment material (P < .05). There was a 
      significant increase in the cardiovascular response in all endodontists in the 
      clinic registrations compared with rest data (P < .05). Values were higher in the 
      strict confinement period and significant for HR when arriving at the clinic (P < 
      .05). CONCLUSIONS: Levels of general anxiety were higher during the first weeks. The 
      chief perceived factors related to anxiety in endodontists and dental assistants 
      were the risk of contagion and protection measures. Higher HR and blood pressure 
      levels were registered during the workday, especially when arriving at the clinic.

AB  - Advanced manufacturing has resulted in significant changes on the shop-floor, 
      influencing work demands and the working environment. The corresponding 
      safety-related effects, including fatigue, have not been captured on an 
      industry-wide scale. This paper presents results of a survey of U.S. manufacturing 
      workers for the: prevalence of fatigue, its root causes and significant factors, and 
      adopted individual fatigue coping methods. The responses from 451 manufacturing 
      employees were analyzed using descriptive data analysis, bivariate analysis and 
      Market Basket Analysis. 57.9% of respondents indicated that they were somewhat 
      fatigued during the past week. They reported the ankles/feet, lower back and eyes 
      were frequently affected body parts and a lack of sleep, work stress and shift 
      schedule were top selected root causes for fatigue. In order to respond to fatigue 
      when it is present, respondents reported coping by drinking caffeinated drinks, 
      stretching/doing exercises and talking with coworkers. Frequent combinations of 
      fatigue causes and individual coping methods were identified. These results may 
      inform the design of fatigue monitoring and mitigation strategies and future 
      research related to fatigue development.

TI  - Duration of Maternal Stress and Depression: Predictors of Newborn Admission to 
      Neonatal Intensive Care Unit and Postpartum Depression.
PG  - 331-41
LID - 10.1097/NNR.0000000000000117 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Maternal psychosocial factors contribute to adverse pregnancy outcome, 
      but very few studies have assessed associations of duration and experiences of 
      stress, depression, and intimate partner violence (IPV) with maternal and newborn 
      outcomes. OBJECTIVES: It was hypothesized that duration and level of maternal 
      stress, depression, and IPV would predict increased risk of adverse maternal/newborn 
      outcomes. METHODS: A secondary data analysis of a population-based data set 
      collected by the Utah Department of Health Pregnancy Risk Assessment and Monitoring 
      System and birth certificates for 4682 live births was conducted, reflecting a total 
      population size of 143,373 live births in 2009-2011. Exposures of interest were 
      experiences and duration of maternal stress, depression, and IPV before and during 
      pregnancy. Outcomes were gestational age, birth weight, newborn admission to the 
      neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), and postpartum depression (PPD) symptoms and 
      diagnosis. RESULTS: After controlling for maternal demographics, body mass index, 
      and smoking, women with greater duration of depression before and during pregnancy 
      showed an increase in admission of their newborn to NICU (adjusted odds ratios 
      [aORs] = 1.66-2.48, p < .001), PPD symptoms (aORs = 3.94-9.13, p < .001), and 
      diagnosis of PPD (aORs = 7.72-59.60, p < .001). More kinds of experiences of 
      maternal stress were associated with higher odds of PPD symptoms (aORs = 1.34-5.51, 
      p < .001), but not PPD diagnosis or NICU admissions. DISCUSSION: Longer lasting 
      maternal depression and stress are associated with poorer outcomes for mothers and 
      newborns. Future prospective studies should evaluate the usefulness of preconception 
      and continuous prenatal risk identification of maternal depression and stress. This 
      would facilitate timely psychosocial interventions as an approach to improving 
      maternal/newborn outcomes for these higher risk women.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We designed and implemented a new model of care, Enhanced Antenatal Care 
      (EAC), which offers a combined approach to midwifery-led care with six one-to-one 
      visits and four group sessions. AIM: To assess EAC in terms of women's satisfaction 
      with care, autonomy in decision-making, and its effectiveness in lowering childbirth 
      fear. METHODS: This was a quasi-experimental controlled trial comparing 32 
      nulliparous women who received EAC (n=32) and usual antenatal care (n=60). We 
      compared women's satisfaction with care and autonomy in decision-making 
      post-intervention using chi-square test. We administered a Fear of Birth Scale pre- 
      and post-intervention and assessed change in fear of birth in each group using the 
      Cohen's d for effect size. To isolate the effect of EAC, we then restricted this 
      analysis to women who did not attend classes alongside maternal care (n=13 in EAC 
      and n=13 in usual care). FINDINGS: Women's satisfaction with care in terms of 
      monitoring their and their baby's health was similar in both groups. Women receiving 
      EAC were more likely than those in usual care to report having received enough 
      information about the postpartum period (75% vs 30%) and parenting (91% vs 55%). 
      Overall, EAC was more effective than usual care in reducing fear of birth (Cohen's 
      d=-0.21), especially among women not attending classes alongside antenatal care 
      (Cohen's d=-0.83). CONCLUSION: This study is the first to report findings on EAC and 
      suggests that this novel model may be beneficial in terms of providing education and 
      support, as well as lowering childbirth fear.

AB  - Quantitative and qualitative analysis of acoustic backscattered signals from the 
      seabed bottom to the sea surface is used worldwide for fish stocks assessment and 
      marine ecosystem monitoring. Huge amounts of raw data are collected yet require 
      tedious expert labeling. This paper focuses on a case study where the ground truth 
      labels are non-obvious: echograms labeling, which is time-consuming and critical for 
      the quality of fisheries and ecological analysis. We investigate how these tasks can 
      benefit from supervised learning algorithms and demonstrate that convolutional 
      neural networks trained with non-stationary datasets can be used to stress parts of 
      a new dataset needing human expert correction. Further development of this approach 
      paves the way toward a standardization of the labeling process in fisheries 
      acoustics and is a good case study for non-obvious data labeling processes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Today, numerous countries are fighting to protect themselves against the 
      Covid-19 crisis, while the policymakers are confounded and empty handed in dealing 
      with this chaotic circumstance. The infection and its impacts have made it difficult 
      to make optimal and suitable decisions. New information technologies play 
      significant roles in such critical situations to address and relieve stress during 
      the coronavirus crisis. This article endeavours to recognize the challenges 
      policymakers have typically experienced during pandemic diseases, including 
      Covid-19, and, accordingly, new information technology capabilities to encounter 
      with them. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The current study utilizes the synthesis of 
      findings of experts' opinions within the systematic review process as the research 
      method to recognize the best available evidence drawn from text and opinion to offer 
      practical guidance for policymakers. RESULTS: The results illustrate that the 
      challenges fall into two categories including; encountering the disease and reducing 
      the results of the disease. Furthermore, Internet of things, cloud computing, 
      machine learning and social networking play the most significant roles to address 
      these challenges.

TI  - A contextual data mining approach toward assisting the treatment of anxiety 
      disorders.
PG  - 567-81
LID - 10.1109/TITB.2009.2038905 [doi]
AB  - Anxiety disorders are considered the most prevalent of mental disorders. 
      Nevertheless, the exact reasons that provoke them to patients remain yet not clearly 
      specified, while the literature concerning the environment for monitoring and 
      treatment support is rather scarce warranting further investigation. Toward this 
      direction, in this study a context-aware approach is proposed, aiming to provide 
      medical supervisors with a series of applications and personalized services targeted 
      to exploit the multiparameter contextual data collected through a long-term 
      monitoring procedure. More specifically, an application that assists the archiving 
      and retrieving of the patients' health records was developed, and four treatment 
      supportive services were considered. The three of them focus on the discovery of 
      possible associations between the patient's contextual data; the last service aims 
      at predicting the stress level a patient might suffer from, in a given context. The 
      proposed approach was experimentally evaluated quantitatively (in terms of 
      computational efficiency and time requirements) and qualitatively by experts on the 
      field of mental health domain. The feedback received was very encouraging and the 
      proposed approach seems quite useful to the anxiety disorders' treatment.

TI  - Protocol of the STRess at Work (STRAW) Project: How to Disentangle Day-to-Day 
      Occupational Stress among Academics Based on EMA, Physiological Data, and Smartphone 
      Sensor and Usage Data.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph17238835 [doi]

AB  - Several studies have reported on increasing psychosocial stress in academia due to 
      work environment risk factors like job insecurity, work-family conflict, research 
      grant applications, and high workload. The STRAW project adds novel aspects to 
      occupational stress research among academic staff by measuring day-to-day stress in 
      their real-world work environments over 15 working days. Work environment risk 
      factors, stress outcomes, health-related behaviors, and work activities were 
      measured repeatedly via an ecological momentary assessment (EMA), specially 
      developed for this project. These results were combined with continuously tracked 
      physiological stress responses using wearable devices and smartphone sensor and 
      usage data. These data provide information on workplace context using our 
      self-developed Android smartphone app. The data were analyzed using two approaches: 
      1) multilevel statistical modelling for repeated data to analyze relations between 
      work environment risk factors and stress outcomes on a within- and between-person 
      level, based on EMA results and a baseline screening, and 2) machine-learning 
      focusing on building prediction models to develop and evaluate acute stress 
      detection models, based on physiological data and smartphone sensor and usage data. 
      Linking these data collection and analysis approaches enabled us to disentangle and 
      model sources, outcomes, and contexts of occupational stress in academia.

AB  - Live sheep export has become a public concern. This study aimed to test a 
      non-contact biometric system based on artificial intelligence to assess heat stress 
      of sheep to be potentially used as automated animal welfare assessment in farms and 
      while in transport. Skin temperature (°C) from head features were extracted from 
      infrared thermal videos (IRTV) using automated tracking algorithms. Two parameter 
      engineering procedures from RGB videos were performed to assess Heart Rate (HR) in 
      beats per minute (BPM) and respiration rate (RR) in breaths per minute (BrPM): (i) 
      using changes in luminosity of the green (G) channel and (ii) changes in the green 
      to red (a) from the CIELAB color scale. A supervised machine learning (ML) 
      classification model was developed using raw RR parameters as inputs to classify 
      cutoff frequencies for low, medium, and high respiration rate (Model 1). A 
      supervised ML regression model was developed using raw HR and RR parameters from 
      Model 1 (Model 2). Results showed that Models 1 and 2 were highly accurate in the 
      estimation of RR frequency level with 96% overall accuracy (Model 1), and HR and RR 
      with R = 0.94 and slope = 0.76 (Model 2) without statistical signs of overfitting.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies assessing the impact of sleep restriction (SR) on blood pressure 
      (BP) are limited by short study length, extreme SR (<4 hours a night), and lack of 
      attention to psychological distress as a possible mediator. METHODS: A 
      community-based cohort was assembled with 237 women (age 34.1 ± 13.5 years; body 
      mass index 25.4 ± 5.4 kg/m(2)), and a randomized, crossover, intervention study was 
      conducted in 41 women (24 completed: age 30.2 ± 6.5 years; body mass index 
      24.3 ± 2.8 kg/m(2)) to determine the causal effect of SR on BP. Sleep was maintained 
      as usual (HS) or reduced by 1.5 hours a night (SR) for 6 weeks. In the cohort, 
      associations between sleep and psychosocial factors were evaluated using 
      multivariable models adjusted for demographic and clinical confounders. In the 
      intervention study, in-office BP was measured weekly; ambulatory BP was measured at 
      end point. Psychological factors were assessed at baseline and end point. 
      Mixed-model analyses with total sleep time (TST, main predictor), week and fraction 
      of time spent in physical activity (covariates), and subject (random effect) were 
      performed. RESULTS: Among the community cohort, higher perceived stress, stressful 
      events and distress, and lower resilience were associated with shorter sleep, worse 
      sleep quality, and greater insomnia symptoms (P < .05). In the intervention, 
      systolic BP increased as TST decreased (TST × week interaction, 
      [coefficient ± standard error] -0.0097 ± 0.0046, P = .036). Wake ambulatory 
      diastolic blood pressure (-0.059 ± 0.022, P = .021) and mean arterial pressure 
      (-0.067 ± 0.023, P = .018) were higher after SR versus HS. Psychological distress 
      variables were not affected by TST and did not mediate the effects of SR on BP. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that SR influences CVD risk in women via 
      mechanisms independent of psychological stressors.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the levels of anxiety and 
      depression, and stress coping strategies used by hemodialysis and kidney transplant 
      patients. METHODS: This study included 138 hemodialysis patients treated at the two 
      private dialysis centers and 76 kidney transplantation patients followed up at the 
      private hospital. Data were collected with socio-demographic characteristics, the 
      Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the Coping Strategies Questionnaire 
      (COPE). RESULTS: The anxiety and depression scores were significantly lower among 
      the transplant group versus the hemodialysis patients. The use of non-functional 
      coping strategies was higher among the patients who were treated with hemodialysis, 
      compared to the renal transplantation patients. The use of problem focused and 
      emotional focused coping strategies were higher among the renal transplant patients, 
      compared to hemodialysis patients. When all participants were evaluated together, 
      turning to religion was the most frequent coping strategy followed by active coping, 
      and positive reinterpretation. In hemodialysis patients, there was a significantly 
      negative correlation between age and problem-focused, emotion-focused and 
      non-functional coping strategies. In contrast, the correlation between education 
      level and both problem-focused and emotion-focused coping strategies was 
      significantly positive. In transplant patients, gender and education level were 
      significantly negative correlated with emotion-focused coping strategies. 
      CONCLUSION: The results of data analysis showed that the hemodialysis patients used 
      fewer functional coping strategies and had more anxiety and depression than kidney 
      transplant patients. It would be helpful to know an individual's coping strategies 
      in the case of a stressful situation in order to determine treatment goals and 
      monitor therapeutic efficacy.

TI  - Daily and weekly mood ratings using a remote capture method in high-risk offspring 
      of bipolar parents: Compliance and symptom monitoring.
PG  - 159-167
LID - 10.1111/bdi.12721 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the compliance and clinical utility of weekly and daily 
      electronic mood symptom monitoring in adolescents and young adults at risk for mood 
      disorder. METHODS: Fifty emerging adult offspring of bipolar parents were recruited 
      from the Flourish Canadian high-risk offspring cohort study along with 108 
      university student controls. Participants were assessed by KSADS/SADS-L 
      semi-structured interviews and used a remote capture method to complete weekly and 
      daily mood symptom ratings using validated scales for 90 consecutive days. Hazard 
      models and generalized estimating equations were used to determine differences in 
      summary scores and regularity of ratings. RESULTS: Seventy-eight and 77% of 
      high-risk offspring and 97% and 93% of controls completed the first 30 days of 
      weekly and daily ratings, respectively. There were no differences in drop-out rates 
      between groups over 90 days (weekly P = 0.2149; daily P = 0.9792). There were no 
      differences in mean summary scores or regularity of weekly anxiety, depressive or 
      hypomanic symptom ratings between high-risk offspring and control groups. However, 
      high-risk offspring compared to controls had daily ratings indicating lower positive 
      affect, higher negative affect and lower self-esteem (P = 0.0317). High-risk 
      offspring with remitted mood disorder compared to those without had more 
      irregularity in weekly anxiety and depressive symptom ratings and daily ratings of 
      lower positive affect, higher negative affect, and higher shame and self-doubt 
      (P = 0.0365). CONCLUSIONS: Findings support that high-resolution electronic mood 
      tracking may be a feasible and clinically useful approach in monitoring emerging 
      psychopathology in young people at high-risk offspring of mood disorder onset or 
      recurrence.

TI  - Xylella fastidiosa causes transcriptional shifts that precede tylose formation and 
      starch depletion in xylem.
PG  - 175-188
LID - 10.1111/mpp.13016 [doi]
AB  - Pierce's disease (PD) in grapevine (Vitis vinifera) is caused by the bacterial 
      pathogen Xylella fastidiosa. X. fastidiosa is limited to the xylem tissue and 
      following infection induces extensive plant-derived xylem blockages, primarily in 
      the form of tyloses. Tylose-mediated vessel occlusions are a hallmark of PD, 
      particularly in susceptible V. vinifera. We temporally monitored tylose development 
      over the course of the disease to link symptom severity to the level of tylose 
      occlusion and the presence/absence of the bacterial pathogen at fine-scale 
      resolution. The majority of vessels containing tyloses were devoid of bacterial 
      cells, indicating that direct, localized perception of X. fastidiosa was not a 
      primary cause of tylose formation. In addition, we used X-ray computed 
      microtomography and machine-learning to determine that X. fastidiosa induces 
      significant starch depletion in xylem ray parenchyma cells. This suggests that a 
      signalling mechanism emanating from the vessels colonized by bacteria enables a 
      systemic response to X. fastidiosa infection. To understand the transcriptional 
      changes underlying these phenotypes, we integrated global transcriptomics into the 
      phenotypes we tracked over the disease spectrum. Differential gene expression 
      analysis revealed that considerable transcriptomic reprogramming occurred during 
      early PD before symptom appearance. Specifically, we determined that many genes 
      associated with tylose formation (ethylene signalling and cell wall biogenesis) and 
      drought stress were up-regulated during both Phase I and Phase II of PD. On the 
      contrary, several genes related to photosynthesis and carbon fixation were 
      down-regulated during both phases. These responses correlate with significant starch 
      depletion observed in ray cells and tylose synthesis in vessels.

TI  - Learning and CRF-Induced Indecision during Escape and Submission in Rainbow Trout 
      during Socially Aggressive Interactions in the Stress-Alternatives Model.
PG  - 515

AB  - Socially stressful environments induce a phenotypic dichotomy of coping measures for 
      populations in response to a dominant aggressor and given a route of egress. This 
      submission- (Stay) or escape-oriented (Escape) dichotomy represents individual 
      decision-making under the stressful influence of hostile social environments. We 
      utilized the Stress-Alternatives Model (SAM) to explore behavioral factors which 
      might predict behavioral phenotype in rainbow trout. The SAM is a compartmentalized 
      tank, with smaller and larger trout separated by an opaque divider until social 
      interaction, and another divider occluding a safety zone, accessible by way of an 
      escape route only large enough for the smaller fish. We hypothesized that 
      distinctive behavioral responses during the first social interaction would indicate 
      a predisposition for one of the behavioral phenotypes in the subsequent 
      interactions. Surprisingly, increased amount or intensity of aggression received had 
      no significant effect on promoting escape in test fish. In fact, during the first 
      day of interaction, fish that turned toward their larger opponent during attack 
      eventually learned to escape. Escaping fish also learn to monitor the patrolling 
      behavior of aggressors, and eventually escape primarily when they are not being 
      observed. Escape per se, was also predicted in trout exhibiting increased movements 
      directed toward the escape route. By contrast, fish that consistently remained in 
      the tank with the aggressor (Stay) showed significantly higher frequency of swimming 
      in subordinate positions, at the top or the bottom of the water column, as well as 
      sitting at the bottom. In addition, a corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF)-induced 
      behavior, snap-shake, was also displayed in untreated fish during aggressive social 
      interaction, and blocked by a CRF(1) receptor antagonist. Especially prevalent among 
      the Stay phenotype, snap-shake indicates indecision regarding escape-related 
      behaviors. Snap-shake was also exhibited by fish of the Escape phenotype, showing a 
      positive correlation with latency to escape. These results demonstrate adaptive 
      responses to stress that reflect evolutionarily conserved stress neurocircuitry 
      which may translate to psychological disorders and decision-making across vertebrate 
      taxa.

AB  - Exhaled breath has proven to be a valuable source of information about human bodies. 
      Subtle differences between volatile organic compounds (VOCs) formed endogenously can 
      be detected and become a base for a potential monitoring tool for health and 
      disease. Until now, there has been a lack of biological and mechanistic knowledge of 
      the processes involved in the production of relevant VOCs. Among the possible 
      sources of health-related and disease-related VOCs are microorganisms found in the 
      respiratory tract and in the gut. Other VOCs in the body are produced by cells that 
      are influenced by the disease, for instance, due to metabolic disorders and/or 
      inflammation. To gain insight into the in vivo production of VOCs by human cells and 
      thus the exhaled breath composition, in vitro experiments involving relevant cells 
      should be studied because they may provide valuable information on the production of 
      VOCs by the affected cells. To this aim we developed and validated a system for 
      dynamically (continuously) collecting headspace air in vitro using a Caco-2 cell 
      line. The system allows the application of different cell lines as well as different 
      experimental setups, including varying exposure times and treatment options while 
      preserving cell viability. Significant correlation (p  ⩽  0.0001) between collection 
      outputs within each studied group confirmed high reproducibility of the collection 
      system. An example of such an application is presented here. We studied the 
      influence of oxidative stress on the VOC composition of the headspace air of Caco-2 
      cells. By comparing the VOC composition of air flushed through empty culture flasks 
      (n  =  35), flasks with culture medium (n  =  35), flasks with medium and cells 
      (n  =  20), flasks with medium and an oxidative stressor (H2O2) (n  =  20), and 
      flasks with medium, stressor, and cells (n  =  20), we were able to separate the 
      effects from the stressor on the cells from all other interactions. Measurements 
      were performed with gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry. 
      Multivariate data analysis allowed detection of significant altered compounds in the 
      compared groups. We found a significant change (p  ⩽  0.001) of the composition of 
      VOCs due to the stressing of the Caco-2 cells by H2O2. A total of ten VOCs showed 
      either increased or decreased abundance in the headspace of the cell cultures due to 
      the presence of the H2O2 stressor.

LID - 10.1039/c4an00824c [doi]
AB  - We have developed a lab-on-a-chip system for continuous and non-invasive monitoring 
      of microfluidic cell cultures using integrated high-frequency contactless impedance 
      spectroscopy. Electrically insulated microfabricated interdigitated electrode 
      structures were embedded into four individually addressable microchambers to 
      reliably and reproducibly detect cell-substrate interactions, cell viability and 
      metabolic activity. While silicon nitride passivated sensor substrates provided a 
      homogeneous cell culture surface that minimized cell orientation along 
      interdigitated electrode structures, the application of high-frequency AC fields 
      reduced the impact of the 300 nm thick passivation layer on sensor sensitivity. The 
      additional implementation of multivariate data analysis methods such as partial 
      least square (PLS) for high-frequency impedance spectra provided unambiguous 
      information on intracellular pathway activation, up and down-regulation of protein 
      synthesis as well as global cellular stress responses. A comparative cell analysis 
      using connective tissue fibroblasts showed that high-frequency contactless impedance 
      spectroscopy and time-resolved quantification of IL-6 secretion using ELISA provided 
      similar results following stimulation with circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines 
      IL-1β and TNFα. The combination of microfluidics with contactless impedance sensing 
      and time-resolved quantification of stress factor release will provide biologist 
      with a new tool to (a) establish a variety of uniform cell culture surfaces that 
      feature complex biochemistries, micro- and nanopatterns; and (b) to simultaneously 
      characterize cell responses under physiologically relevant conditions using a 
      complementary non-invasive cell analysis method.

TI  - Climatic and anthropogenic drivers of northern Amazon fires during the 2015-2016 El 
      Niño event.
PG  - 2514-2527

AB  - The strong El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event that occurred in 2015-2016 
      caused extreme drought in the northern Brazilian Amazon, especially in the state of 
      Roraima, increasing fire occurrence. Here we map the extent of precipitation and 
      fire anomalies and quantify the effects of climatic and anthropogenic drivers on 
      fire occurrence during the 2015-2016 dry season (from December 2015 to March 2016) 
      in the state of Roraima. To achieve these objectives we first estimated the spatial 
      pattern of precipitation anomalies, based on long-term data from the TRMM (Tropical 
      Rainfall Measuring Mission), and the fire anomaly, based on MODIS (Moderate 
      Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) active fire detections during the referred 
      period. Then, we integrated climatic and anthropogenic drivers in a Maximum Entropy 
      (MaxEnt) model to quantify fire probability, assessing (1) the model accuracy during 
      the 2015-2016 and the 2016-2017 dry seasons; (2) the relative importance of each 
      predictor variable on the model predictive performance; and (3) the response curves, 
      showing how each environmental variable affects the fire probability. Approximately 
      59% (132,900 km(2) ) of the study area was exposed to precipitation anomalies ≤-1 
      standard deviation (SD) in January and ~48% (~106,800 km(2) ) in March. About 38% 
      (86,200 km(2) ) of the study area experienced fire anomalies ≥1 SD in at least one 
      month between December 2015 and March 2016. The distance to roads and the direct 
      ENSO effect on fire occurrence were the two most influential variables on model 
      predictive performance. Despite the improvement of governmental actions of fire 
      prevention and firefighting in Roraima since the last intense ENSO event 
      (1997-1998), we show that fire still gets out of control in the state during extreme 
      drought events. Our results indicate that if no prevention actions are undertaken, 
      future road network expansion and a climate-induced increase in water stress will 
      amplify fire occurrence in the northern Amazon, even in its humid dense forests. As 
      an additional outcome of our analysis, we conclude that the model and the data we 
      used may help to guide on-the-ground fire-prevention actions and firefighting 
      planning and therefore minimize fire-related ecosystems degradation, economic losses 
      and carbon emissions in Roraima.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Interactive Voice Response (IVR) technology has become an increasingly 
      popular and valid method for collecting Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) data 
      on a variety of health-risk behaviors, including daily alcohol use and cigarette 
      smoking, and for stimulating behavior change. However, very little research has 
      evaluated the parameters of IVR compliance and reactivity in respondents who may 
      have greater problem severity than samples previously examined in published IVR 
      studies. This study examined the prevalence and correlates of use, receptivity and 
      reactivity to IVR monitoring in 77 untreated risky drinking smokers who were 
      motivated to quit within the next 6 months. METHODS: Respondents completed twice 
      daily IVR assessments for 28 days and were re-assessed immediately after IVR to 
      measure receptivity and reactivity to daily monitoring and six months post-baseline. 
      RESULTS: Mean compliance rate was 70.6%, with a morning rate of 72.4% and an evening 
      compliance rate of 68.9% out of all possible surveys. IVR assessments of drinking 
      and smoking were significantly associated with baseline paper-pencil reports of the 
      same. African-American participants and those who reported more daily stressful 
      events were more compliant. Between the baseline session and the 6-month follow-up, 
      68% of the sample reported engaging in some form of smoking behavior change (50% 
      reduction in CPD, a quit attempt, past-month continuous abstinence). Nearly 80% 
      reported increased awareness of their behavior due to the IVR and 40% reported 
      intentional behavior change from IVR monitoring. The odds of making a quit attempt 
      at the 6-month follow-up were significantly higher among respondents who reported 
      making purposeful changes to their smoking as a result of IVR monitoring (AOR=3.25, 
      p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Reactivity was associated with behavior change outcomes. IVR 
      may be a useful tool for motivating behavior change in smokers with alcohol-use 
      problems.

TI  - Creating state of the art, next-generation Virtual Reality exposure therapies for 
      anxiety disorders using consumer hardware platforms: design considerations and 
      future directions.
PG  - 404-420
LID - 10.1080/16506073.2017.1280843 [doi]
AB  - Decades of research and more than 20 randomized controlled trials show that Virtual 
      Reality exposure therapy (VRET) is effective in reducing fear and anxiety. 
      Unfortunately, few providers or patients have had access to the costly and technical 
      equipment previously required. Recent technological advances in the form of consumer 
      Virtual Reality (VR) systems (e.g. Oculus Rift and Samsung Gear), however, now make 
      widespread use of VRET in clinical settings and as self-help applications possible. 
      In this literature review, we detail the current state of VR technology and discuss 
      important therapeutic considerations in designing self-help and clinician-led VRETs, 
      such as platform choice, exposure progression design, inhibitory learning 
      strategies, stimuli tailoring, gamification, virtual social learning and more. We 
      illustrate how these therapeutic components can be incorporated and utilized in VRET 
      applications, taking full advantage of the unique capabilities of virtual 
      environments, and showcase some of these features by describing the development of a 
      consumer-ready, gamified self-help VRET application for low-cost commercially 
      available VR hardware. We also raise and discuss challenges in the planning, 
      development, evaluation, and dissemination of VRET applications, including the need 
      for more high-quality research. We conclude by discussing how new technology (e.g. 
      eye-tracking) can be incorporated into future VRETs and how widespread use of VRET 
      self-help applications will enable collection of naturalistic "Big Data" that 
      promises to inform learning theory and behavioral therapy in general.

TI  - A pilot study of the feasibility and outcomes of yoga for lung cancer survivors.
PG  - 162-74
LID - 10.1188/14.ONF.162-174 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To determine the feasibility of a standardized yoga intervention 
      for survivors of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and, effects on sleep, mood, 
      salivary cortisol levels, and quality of life (QOL). DESIGN: This 14-week, 
      one-group, repeated-measures study included a three-week preintervention phase, 
      eight weeks of yoga classes (40 minutes once per week) and home practice, and a 
      three-week postintervention phase. Follow-up occurred at three and six months 
      poststudy. SETTING: A community-based cancer support center in the midwestern United 
      States. SAMPLE: 7 adults who had completed initial treatment for stages I-IIIa 
      NSCLC. METHODS: A standardized yoga protocol was developed prior to the study by 
      experts in the field. Breathing ease was monitored before, during, and after classes 
      to assess feasibility of movement without compromising respiratory status while 
      doing yoga. Data analysis included descriptive statistics, repeated-measures 
      analysis of variance, and salivary cortisol analysis. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Sleep 
      quality, mood, salivary cortisol, and QOL were assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep 
      Quality Index, Profile of Mood States-Brief, a cortisol measurement, and the Medical 
      Outcomes Survey SF-36®, respectively. Breathing ease was assessed using a dyspnea 
      numeric rating scale as well as observation of participants. FINDINGS: Participants 
      with varying stages of disease and length of survivorship were able to perform yoga 
      without respiratory distress. Class attendance exceeded 95%, and all practiced at 
      home. Mood, sleep efficiency, and QOL significantly improved; salivary cortisol 
      levels decreased over time. CONCLUSIONS: Yoga was feasible for NSCLC survivors 
      without further compromising breathing with movement. Potential benefits were 
      identified, supporting the need for future clinical trials with larger samples 
      stratified by cancer stage, treatment, and length of survivorship. IMPLICATIONS FOR 
      NURSING: Nurses and healthcare providers should consider yoga as a mind-body 
      practice to manage stress, improve mood and sleep, and potentially enhance QOL for 
      NSCLC survivors.

AB  - In this study, a computer-based feedback, decision and clinical problem-solving 
      system for clinical practice will be described - the Trier Treatment Navigator 
      (TTN). The paper deals with the underlying research concepts related to personalized 
      pre-treatment recommendations for drop-out risk and optimal treatment strategy 
      selection as well as personalized adaptive recommendations during treatment. The 
      development sample consisted of 1234 patients treated with cognitive behavioral 
      therapy (CBT). Modern statistical machine learning techniques were used to develop 
      personalized recommendations. Drop-out analyses resulted in seven significant 
      predictors explaining 12.0% of variance. The prediction of optimal treatment 
      strategies resulted in differential prediction models substantially improving effect 
      sizes and reliable improvement rates. The dynamic failure boundary reliably 
      identified patients with a higher risk for no improvement or deterioration and 
      indicated the usage of clinical problem-solving tools in risk areas. The probability 
      to be reliably improved for patients identified as at risk for treatment failure was 
      about half of the probability for other patients (35% vs. 62.15%; 
      χ(2)(df=1) = 82.77, p < .001). Results related to the computer-based feedback system 
      are discussed with regard to the implication for clinical applications as well as 
      clinical training and future research possibilities.

TI  - A Comprehensive Analysis on Wearable Acceleration Sensors in Human Activity 
      Recognition.
LID - 10.3390/s17030529 [doi]
LID - 529
AB  - Sensor-based motion recognition integrates the emerging area of wearable sensors 
      with novel machine learning techniques to make sense of low-level sensor data and 
      provide rich contextual information in a real-life application. Although Human 
      Activity Recognition (HAR) problem has been drawing the attention of researchers, it 
      is still a subject of much debate due to the diverse nature of human activities and 
      their tracking methods. Finding the best predictive model in this problem while 
      considering different sources of heterogeneities can be very difficult to analyze 
      theoretically, which stresses the need of an experimental study. Therefore, in this 
      paper, we first create the most complete dataset, focusing on accelerometer sensors, 
      with various sources of heterogeneities. We then conduct an extensive analysis on 
      feature representations and classification techniques (the most comprehensive 
      comparison yet with 293 classifiers) for activity recognition. Principal component 
      analysis is applied to reduce the feature vector dimension while keeping essential 
      information. The average classification accuracy of eight sensor positions is 
      reported to be 96.44% ± 1.62% with 10-fold evaluation, whereas accuracy of 79.92% ± 
      9.68% is reached in the subject-independent evaluation. This study presents 
      significant evidence that we can build predictive models for HAR problem under more 
      realistic conditions, and still achieve highly accurate results.

TI  - Long-term imaging of cellular forces with high precision by elastic resonator 
      interference stress microscopy.
PG  - 864-872
LID - 10.1038/ncb3561 [doi]
AB  - Cellular forces are crucial for many biological processes but current methods to 
      image them have limitations with respect to data analysis, resolution and 
      throughput. Here, we present a robust approach to measure mechanical cell-substrate 
      interactions in diverse biological systems by interferometrically detecting 
      deformations of an elastic micro-cavity. Elastic resonator interference stress 
      microscopy (ERISM) yields stress maps with exceptional precision and large dynamic 
      range (2 nm displacement resolution over a >1 μm range, translating into 1 pN force 
      sensitivity). This enables investigation of minute vertical stresses (<1 Pa) 
      involved in podosome protrusion, protein-specific cell-substrate interaction and 
      amoeboid migration through spatial confinement in real time. ERISM requires no 
      zero-force reference and avoids phototoxic effects, which facilitates force 
      monitoring over multiple days and at high frame rates and eliminates the need to 
      detach cells after measurements. This allows observation of slow processes such as 
      differentiation and further investigation of cells, for example, by immunostaining.

TI  - Temperature Field Boundary Conditions and Lateral Temperature Gradient Effect on a 
      PC Box-Girder Bridge Based on Real-Time Solar Radiation and Spatial Temperature 
      Monitoring.
LID - 10.3390/s20185261 [doi]

AB  - Climate change could impose great influence on infrastructures. Previous studies 
      have shown that solar radiation is one of the most important factors causing the 
      change in temperature distribution in bridges. The current temperature distribution 
      models developed in the past are mainly based on the meteorological data from the 
      nearest weather station, empirical formulas, or the testing data from model tests. 
      In this study, a five-span continuous Prestressed-concrete box-girder bridge was 
      instrumented with pyranometers, anemometers, strain gauges, displacement gauges, and 
      temperature sensors on the top and bottom slabs and webs to measure the solar 
      radiation, wind speeds, strain, displacement, and surface temperatures, 
      respectively. The continuously monitoring data between May 2019 and May 2020 was 
      used to study the temperature distributions caused by solar radiation. A maximum 
      positive lateral temperature gradient prediction model has been developed based on 
      the solar radiation data analysis. Then, the solar radiation boundary condition 
      obtained from the monitoring data and the lateral temperature gradient prediction 
      model were utilized to compute the tensile stresses in the longitudinal and 
      transverse directions. It was demonstrated in this study that the tensile stress 
      caused by the lateral temperature gradient was so significant that it cannot be 
      ignored in structural design.

TI  - Classification of Rice Heavy Metal Stress Levels Based on Phenological 
      Characteristics Using Remote Sensing Time-Series Images and Data Mining Algorithms.
LID - 10.3390/s18124425 [doi]

AB  - Heavy metal pollution in crops leads to phenological changes, which can be monitored 
      by remote sensing technology. The present study aims to develop a method for 
      accurately evaluating heavy metal stress in rice based on remote sensing phenology. 
      First, the enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (ESTARFM) 
      was applied to blend Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and 
      Landsat to generate a time series of fusion images at 30 m resolution, and then the 
      vegetation indices (VIs) related to greenness and moisture content of the rice 
      canopy were calculated to create the time-series of VIs. Second, phenological 
      metrics were extracted from the time-series data of VIs, and a feature selection 
      scheme was designed to acquire an optimal phenological metric subset. Finally, an 
      ensemble model with optimal phenological metrics as classification features was 
      built using random forest (RF) and gradient boosting (GB) classifiers, and the 
      classification of stress levels was implemented. The results demonstrated that the 
      overall accuracy of discrimination for different stress levels is greater than 98%. 
      This study suggests that fusion images can be utilized to detect heavy metal stress 
      in rice, and the proposed method may be applicable to classify stress levels.

TI  - Stress Detection Using Wearable Physiological and Sociometric Sensors.
PG  - 1650041
LID - 10.1142/S0129065716500416 [doi]
AB  - Stress remains a significant social problem for individuals in modern societies. 
      This paper presents a machine learning approach for the automatic detection of 
      stress of people in a social situation by combining two sensor systems that capture 
      physiological and social responses. We compare the performance using different 
      classifiers including support vector machine, AdaBoost, and [Formula: see 
      text]-nearest neighbor. Our experimental results show that by combining the 
      measurements from both sensor systems, we could accurately discriminate between 
      stressful and neutral situations during a controlled Trier social stress test 
      (TSST). Moreover, this paper assesses the discriminative ability of each sensor 
      modality individually and considers their suitability for real-time stress 
      detection. Finally, we present an study of the most discriminative features for 
      stress detection.

TI  - Quantitative monitoring of sucrose, reducing sugar and total sugar dynamics for 
      phenotyping of water-deficit stress tolerance in rice through spectroscopy and 
      chemometrics.

AB  - In the present investigation, the changes in sucrose, reducing and total sugar 
      content due to water-deficit stress in rice leaves were modeled using visible, near 
      infrared (VNIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) spectroscopy. The objectives of the 
      study were to identify the best vegetation indices and suitable multivariate 
      technique based on precise analysis of hyperspectral data (350 to 2500nm) and 
      sucrose, reducing sugar and total sugar content measured at different stress levels 
      from 16 different rice genotypes. Spectral data analysis was done to identify 
      suitable spectral indices and models for sucrose estimation. Novel spectral indices 
      in near infrared (NIR) range viz. ratio spectral index (RSI) and normalised 
      difference spectral indices (NDSI) sensitive to sucrose, reducing sugar and total 
      sugar content were identified which were subsequently calibrated and validated. The 
      RSI and NDSI models had R(2) values of 0.65, 0.71 and 0.67; RPD values of 1.68, 1.95 
      and 1.66 for sucrose, reducing sugar and total sugar, respectively for validation 
      dataset. Different multivariate spectral models such as artificial neural network 
      (ANN), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), multiple linear regression 
      (MLR), partial least square regression (PLSR), random forest regression (RFR) and 
      support vector machine regression (SVMR) were also evaluated. The best performing 
      multivariate models for sucrose, reducing sugars and total sugars were found to be, 
      MARS, ANN and MARS, respectively with respect to RPD values of 2.08, 2.44, and 1.93. 
      Results indicated that VNIR and SWIR spectroscopy combined with multivariate 
      calibration can be used as a reliable alternative to conventional methods for 
      measurement of sucrose, reducing sugars and total sugars of rice under water-deficit 
      stress as this technique is fast, economic, and noninvasive.

TI  - Specim IQ: Evaluation of a New, Miniaturized Handheld Hyperspectral Camera and Its 
      Application for Plant Phenotyping and Disease Detection.
LID - 10.3390/s18020441 [doi]
LID - 441
AB  - Hyperspectral imaging sensors are promising tools for monitoring crop plants or 
      vegetation in different environments. Information on physiology, architecture or 
      biochemistry of plants can be assessed non-invasively and on different scales. For 
      instance, hyperspectral sensors are implemented for stress detection in plant 
      phenotyping processes or in precision agriculture. Up to date, a variety of 
      non-imaging and imaging hyperspectral sensors is available. The measuring process 
      and the handling of most of these sensors is rather complex. Thus, during the last 
      years the demand for sensors with easy user operability arose. The present study 
      introduces the novel hyperspectral camera Specim IQ from Specim (Oulu, Finland). The 
      Specim IQ is a handheld push broom system with integrated operating system and 
      controls. Basic data handling and data analysis processes, such as pre-processing 
      and classification routines are implemented within the camera software. This study 
      provides an introduction into the measurement pipeline of the Specim IQ as well as a 
      radiometric performance comparison with a well-established hyperspectral imager. 
      Case studies for the detection of powdery mildew on barley at the canopy scale and 
      the spectral characterization of Arabidopsis thaliana mutants grown under stressed 
      and non-stressed conditions are presented.

AB  - The classification of abnormalities in ultrasound images is the monitoring tool of 
      fluid to air passage in the lung. In this study, the adaptive median filtering 
      technique is employed for the preprocessing step. The preprocessed image is then 
      extracted the features by the convoluted local tetra pattern, histogram of oriented 
      gradient, Haralick feature extraction and the complete local binary pattern. The 
      extracted features are selected by applying particle swarm optimization and 
      differential evolution feature selection. In the final stage, classifiers namely 
      relevance vector machine (RVM), and multi-level RVM are employed to perform 
      classification of the lung diseases. The diseases respiratory distress syndrome 
      (RDS), transient tachypnea of the new born, meconium aspiration syndrome, 
      pneumothorax, bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and lung cancer are used for training and 
      testing. The experimental analysis exhibits better accuracy, sensitivity, 
      specificity, pixel count and fitness value than the other existing methods. The 
      classification accuracy of above 90% is accomplished by multi-level RVM classifier. 
      The system has been tested with a number of ultrasound lung images and has achieved 
      satisfactory results in classifying the lung diseases.

TI  - Applications of deep convolutional neural networks to predict length, circumference, 
      and weight from mostly dewatered images of fish.

AB  - Simple biometric data of fish aid fishery management tasks such as monitoring the 
      structure of fish populations and regulating recreational harvest. While these data 
      are foundational to fishery research and management, the collection of length and 
      weight data through physical handling of the fish is challenging as it is time 
      consuming for personnel and can be stressful for the fish. Recent advances in 
      imaging technology and machine learning now offer alternatives for capturing 
      biometric data. To investigate the potential of deep convolutional neural networks 
      to predict biometric data, several regressors were trained and evaluated on data 
      stemming from the FishL™ Recognition System and manual measurements of length, 
      girth, and weight. The dataset consisted of 694 fish from 22 different species 
      common to Laurentian Great Lakes. Even with such a diverse dataset and variety of 
      presentations by the fish, the regressors proved to be robust and achieved 
      competitive mean percent errors in the range of 5.5 to 7.6% for length and girth on 
      an evaluation dataset. Potential applications of this work could increase the 
      efficiency and accuracy of routine survey work by fishery professionals and provide 
      a means for longer-term automated collection of fish biometric data.

AB  - In order to model students' happiness, we apply machine learning methods to data 
      collected from undergrad students monitored over the course of one month each. The 
      data collected include physiological signals, location, smartphone logs, and survey 
      responses to behavioral questions. Each day, participants reported their wellbeing 
      on measures including stress, health, and happiness. Because of the relationship 
      between happiness and depression, modeling happiness may help us to detect 
      individuals who are at risk of depression and guide interventions to help them. We 
      are also interested in how behavioral factors (such as sleep and social activity) 
      affect happiness positively and negatively. A variety of machine learning and 
      feature selection techniques are compared, including Gaussian Mixture Models and 
      ensemble classification. We achieve 70% classification accuracy of self-reported 
      happiness on held-out test data.

TI  - Effect of Clinician Training in the Modular Approach to Therapy for Children vs 
      Usual Care on Clinical Outcomes and Use of Empirically Supported Treatments: A 
      Randomized Clinical Trial.
PG  - e2011799
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.11799 [doi]
LID - e2011799
AB  - IMPORTANCE: The Modular Approach to Therapy for Children (MATCH) was developed to 
      address the comorbidities common among clinically referred youth, with beneficial 
      outcomes shown in 2 US randomized clinical trials, where it outperformed both usual 
      clinical care and single disorder-specific treatments. OBJECTIVE: To determine 
      whether MATCH training of clinicians would result in more use of empirically 
      supported treatment (EST) and better clinical outcomes than usual care (UC) in the 
      publicly funded, multidisciplinary context of New Zealand. DESIGN, SETTING, AND 
      PARTICIPANTS: This multisite, single-blind, computer-randomized clinical 
      effectiveness trial compared MATCH with UC in child and adolescent mental health 
      services in 5 regions of New Zealand. Recruitment occurred from March 2014 to July 
      2015, and a 3-month follow-up assessment was completed by May 2016. Clinicians at 
      participating child and adolescent mental health services were randomized (1:1) to 
      undertake training in MATCH or to deliver UC, and young people with anxiety, 
      depression, trauma-related symptoms, or disruptive behavior seeking treatment at 
      child and adolescent mental health services were randomized (1:1) to receive MATCH 
      or UC. Participants and research assistants were blind to allocation. Data analysis 
      was performed from April 2016 to July 2017. INTERVENTIONS: MATCH comprises EST 
      components for flexible management of common mental health problems. UC includes 
      case management and psychological therapies. Both can include pharmacotherapy. MAIN 
      OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: There were 3 primary outcomes: trajectory of change of 
      clinical severity, as measured by weekly ratings on the Brief Problem Monitor (BPM); 
      fidelity to EST content, as measured by audio recordings of therapy sessions coded 
      using the Therapy Integrity in Evidence Based Interventions: Observational Coding 
      System; and efficiency of service delivery, as measured by duration of therapy 
      (days) and clinician time (minutes). RESULTS: The study included 65 clinicians (mean 
      age, 38.7 years; range, 23.0-64.0 years; 54 female [83%]; MATCH, 32 clinicians; UC, 
      33 clinicians) and 206 young people (mean age, 11.2 years; range 7.0-14.0 years; 122 
      female [61%]; MATCH, 102 patients; UC, 104 patients). For the BPM total ratings for 
      parents, there was a mean (SE) slope of -1.04 (0.14) (1-year change, -6.12) in the 
      MATCH group vs -1.04 (0.10) (1-year change, -6.17) in the UC group (effect size, 
      0.00; 95% CI, -0.27 to 0.28; P = .96). For the BPM total for youths, the mean (SE) 
      slope was -0.74 (0.15) (1-year change, -4.35) in the MATCH group vs -0.73 (0.10) 
      (1-year change, -4.32) in the UC group (effect size, -0.02; 95% CI, -0.30 to 0.26; 
      P = .97). Primary analyses (intention-to-treat) showed no difference in clinical 
      outcomes or efficiency despite significantly higher fidelity to EST content in the 
      MATCH group (58 coded sessions; mean [SD], 80.0% [20.0%]) than the UC group (51 
      coded sessions; mean [SD], 57.0% [32.0%]; F(1,108) = 23.0; P < .001). With regard to 
      efficiency of service delivery, there were no differences in total face-to-face 
      clinician time between the MATCH group (mean [SD], 806 [527] minutes) and the 
      UC group (mean [SD], 677 [539] minutes) or the overall duration of therapy between 
      the MATCH group (mean [SD], 167 [107 days]) and the UC group (mean [SD], 159 [107] 
      days). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: MATCH significantly increased adherence to EST 
      practices but did not improve outcomes or efficiency. The nonsuperiority of MATCH 
      may be attributable to high levels of EST use in UC in New Zealand. TRIAL

TI  - Improved classification accuracy of powdery mildew infection levels of wine grapes 
      by spatial-spectral analysis of hyperspectral images.
PG  - 47
LID - 10.1186/s13007-017-0198-y [doi]
LID - 47
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hyperspectral imaging is an emerging means of assessing plant vitality, 
      stress parameters, nutrition status, and diseases. Extraction of target values from 
      the high-dimensional datasets either relies on pixel-wise processing of the full 
      spectral information, appropriate selection of individual bands, or calculation of 
      spectral indices. Limitations of such approaches are reduced classification 
      accuracy, reduced robustness due to spatial variation of the spectral information 
      across the surface of the objects measured as well as a loss of information 
      intrinsic to band selection and use of spectral indices. In this paper we present an 
      improved spatial-spectral segmentation approach for the analysis of hyperspectral 
      imaging data and its application for the prediction of powdery mildew infection 
      levels (disease severity) of intact Chardonnay grape bunches shortly before 
      veraison. RESULTS: Instead of calculating texture features (spatial features) for 
      the huge number of spectral bands independently, dimensionality reduction by means 
      of Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) was applied first to derive a few descriptive 
      image bands. Subsequent classification was based on modified Random Forest 
      classifiers and selective extraction of texture parameters from the integral image 
      representation of the image bands generated. Dimensionality reduction, integral 
      images, and the selective feature extraction led to improved classification 
      accuracies of up to [Formula: see text] for detached berries used as a reference 
      sample (training dataset). Our approach was validated by predicting infection levels 
      for a sample of 30 intact bunches. Classification accuracy improved with the number 
      of decision trees of the Random Forest classifier. These results corresponded with 
      qPCR results. An accuracy of 0.87 was achieved in classification of healthy, 
      infected, and severely diseased bunches. However, discrimination between visually 
      healthy and infected bunches proved to be challenging for a few samples, perhaps due 
      to colonized berries or sparse mycelia hidden within the bunch or airborne conidia 
      on the berries that were detected by qPCR. CONCLUSIONS: An advanced approach to 
      hyperspectral image classification based on combined spatial and spectral image 
      features, potentially applicable to many available hyperspectral sensor 
      technologies, has been developed and validated to improve the detection of powdery 
      mildew infection levels of Chardonnay grape bunches. The spatial-spectral approach 
      improved especially the detection of light infection levels compared with pixel-wise 
      spectral data analysis. This approach is expected to improve the speed and accuracy 
      of disease detection once the thresholds for fungal biomass detected by 
      hyperspectral imaging are established; it can also facilitate monitoring in plant 
      phenotyping of grapevine and additional crops.

AB  - Software advancements in the last several years have had a significant impact on 
      proteomics from method development to data analysis. Herein, we detail a method, 
      which uses our in-house developed software tool termed Skyline, for empirical 
      refinement of candidate peptides from targeted proteins. The method consists of four 
      main steps from generation of a testable hypothesis, method development, peptide 
      refinement, to peptide validation. The ultimate goal is to identify the best 
      performing peptide in terms of ionization efficiency, reproducibility, specificity, 
      and chromatographic characteristics to monitor as a proxy for protein abundance. It 
      is important to emphasize that this method allows the user to perform this 
      refinement procedure in the sample matrix and organism of interest with the 
      instrumentation available. Finally, the method is demonstrated in a case study to 
      determine the best peptide to monitor the abundance of surfactant protein B in lung 
      aspirates.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of escitalopram monotherapy in the 
      treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) on the basis of pooled data analysis of 
      4 Chinese clinical trials.A total of 649 outpatients with MDD score of ≥18 at the 
      17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD17) were included across 4 eligible 
      studies. Patients were treated with 10 mg/day escitalopram for 2 weeks, and then 
      20 mg/day escitalopram was administered if the clinical response was poor.The change 
      in total HAMD17 score was significantly greater in moderate MDD group than in other 
      subgroups (P < .001), but the proportion of responders and remission rate in 
      moderate MDD group were markedly lower than in mild MDD group. As compared to 
      patients with concomitant anxiety, anxiety free patients showed significant 
      improvement in total HAMD17 score at days 14 and 28 (P < .05). However, there was no 
      significant difference in the change of total HAMD17 score at day 7 and the end of 
      study. According to clinical global impression (CGI) score, the total response rate 
      (very much improved and much improved) was 86.7%. There were 479 adverse events 
      (AEs), but serious AEs were not observed. A total of 3.39% (22/649) of patients 
      withdrew from these studies due to AEs. The most common (incidence ≥2.0%) AEs were 
      nausea, dry mouth, somnolence, dizziness, fatigue, dyspepsia, liver dysfunction, and 
      loss of appetite.Escitalopram monotherapy is effective and safe in the treatment of 
      MDD in Chinese patients, and therapeutic efficacy is dependent on the severity of 
      MDD. Further study is needed to identify better predictors of therapeutic responses.

AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate online search activity of suicide-related words in South 
      Korean adolescents through data mining of social media Web sites as the suicide rate 
      in South Korea is one of the highest in the world. METHODS: Out of more than 2.35 
      billion posts for 2 years from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2012 on 163 social 
      media Web sites in South Korea, 99,693 suicide-related documents were retrieved by 
      Crawler and analyzed using text mining and opinion mining. These data were further 
      combined with monthly employment rate, monthly rental prices index, monthly youth 
      suicide rate, and monthly number of reported bully victims to fit multilevel models 
      as well as structural equation models. RESULTS: The link from grade pressure to 
      suicide risk showed the largest standardized path coefficient (beta = .357, p < 
      .001) in structural models and a significant random effect (p < .01) in multilevel 
      models. Depression was a partial mediator between suicide risk and grade pressure, 
      low body image, victims of bullying, and concerns about disease. The largest total 
      effect was observed in the grade pressure to depression to suicide risk. The 
      multilevel models indicate about 27% of the variance in the daily suicide-related 
      word search activity is explained by month-to-month variations. A lower employment 
      rate, a higher rental prices index, and more bullying were associated with an 
      increased suicide-related word search activity. CONCLUSIONS: Academic pressure 
      appears to be the biggest contributor to Korean adolescents' suicide risk. Real-time 
      suicide-related word search activity monitoring and response system needs to be 
      developed.

AB  - This paper presents a machine learning based approach for analyses of photos 
      collected from laboratory experiments conducted to assess the potential impact of 
      water-based drill cuttings on deep-water rhodolith-forming calcareous algae. This 
      pilot study uses imaging technology to quantify and monitor the stress levels of the 
      calcareous algae Mesophyllum engelhartii (Foslie) Adey caused by various degrees of 
      light exposure, flow intensity and amount of sediment. A machine learning based 
      algorithm was applied to assess the temporal variation of the calcareous algae size 
      (∼ mass) and color automatically. Measured size and color were correlated to the 
      photosynthetic efficiency (maximum quantum yield of charge separation in photosystem 
      II, [Formula: see text]) and degree of sediment coverage using multivariate 
      regression. The multivariate regression showed correlations between time and 
      calcareous algae sizes, as well as correlations between fluorescence and calcareous 
      algae colors.

AB  - Evidence currently suggests that as a species Mycobacterium tuberculosis exhibits 
      very little genomic sequence diversity. Despite limited genetic variability, members 
      of the M. tuberculosis complex (MTBC) have been shown to exhibit vast discrepancies 
      in phenotypic presentation in terms of virulence, elicited immune response and 
      transmissibility. Here, we used qualitative and quantitative mass spectrometry tools 
      to investigate the proteomes of seven clinically-relevant mycobacterial strains-four 
      M. tuberculosis strains, M. bovis, M. bovis BCG, and M. avium-that show varying 
      degrees of pathogenicity and virulence, in an effort to rationalize the observed 
      phenotypic differences. Following protein preparation, liquid chromatography mass 
      spectrometry (LC MS/MS) and data capture were carried out using an LTQ Orbitrap 
      Velos. Data analysis was carried out using a novel bioinformatics strategy, which 
      yielded high protein coverage and was based on high confidence peptides. Through 
      this approach, we directly identified a total of 3788 unique M. tuberculosis 
      proteins out of a theoretical proteome of 4023 proteins and identified an average of 
      3290 unique proteins for each of the MTBC organisms (representing 82% of the 
      theoretical proteomes), as well as 4250 unique M. avium proteins (80% of the 
      theoretical proteome). Data analysis showed that all major classes of proteins are 
      represented in every strain, but that there are significant quantitative differences 
      between strains. Targeted selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assays were used to 
      quantify the observed differential expression of a subset of 23 proteins identified 
      by comparison to gene expression data as being of particular relevance to virulence. 
      This analysis revealed differences in relative protein abundance between strains for 
      proteins which may promote bacterial fitness in the more virulent W. Beijing strain. 
      These differences may contribute to this strain's capacity for surviving within the 
      host and resisting treatment, which has contributed to its rapid spread. Through 
      this approach, we have begun to describe the proteomic portrait of a successful 
      mycobacterial pathogen. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier 
      PXD004165.

TI  - Correlation of Shoulder and Elbow Kinetics With Ball Velocity in Collegiate Baseball 
      Pitchers.
PG  - 629-33
LID - 10.4085/1062-6040-50.1.06 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Throwing a baseball is a dynamic and violent act that places large 
      magnitudes of stress on the shoulder and elbow. Specific injuries at the elbow and 
      glenohumeral joints have been linked to several kinetic variables throughout the 
      throwing motion. However, very little research has directly examined the 
      relationship between these kinetic variables and ball velocity. OBJECTIVE: To 
      examine the correlation of peak ball velocity with elbow-valgus torque, shoulder 
      external-rotation torque, and shoulder-distraction force in a group of collegiate 
      baseball pitchers. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Motion-analysis 
      laboratory. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-seven asymptomatic National 
      Collegiate Athletic Association Division I baseball pitchers (age = 19.5 ± 1.2 
      years, height = 186.2 ± 5.7 cm, mass = 86.7 ± 7.0 kg; 48 right handed, 19 left 
      handed). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): We measured peak ball velocity using a radar gun 
      and shoulder and elbow kinetics of the throwing arm using 8 electronically 
      synchronized, high-speed digital cameras. We placed 26 reflective markers on 
      anatomical landmarks of each participant to track 3-dimensional coordinate data. The 
      average data from the 3 highest-velocity fastballs thrown for strikes were used for 
      data analysis. We calculated a Pearson correlation coefficient to determine the 
      associations between ball velocity and peak elbow-valgus torque, 
      shoulder-distraction force, and shoulder external-rotation torque (P < .05). 
      RESULTS: A weak positive correlation was found between ball velocity and 
      shoulder-distraction force (r = 0.257; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.02, 0.47; 
      r(2) = 0.066; P = .018). However, no significant correlations were noted between 
      ball velocity and elbow-valgus torque (r = 0.199; 95% CI = -0.043, 0.419; r(2) = 
      0.040; P = .053) or shoulder external-rotation torque (r = 0.097; 95% CI = -0.147, 
      0.329; r(2) = 0.009; P = .217). CONCLUSIONS: Although a weak positive correlation 
      was present between ball velocity and shoulder-distraction force, no significant 
      association was seen between ball velocity and elbow-valgus torque or shoulder 
      external-rotation torque. Therefore, other factors, such as improper pitching 
      mechanics, may contribute more to increases in joint kinetics than peak ball 
      velocity.

AB  - Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide. Diagnosis and 
      treatment in early stages increase cure chances. The temperature of cancerous tissue 
      is generally higher than that of healthy surrounding tissues, making thermography an 
      option to be considered in screening strategies of this cancer type. This paper 
      proposes a hybrid methodology for analyzing dynamic infrared thermography in order 
      to indicate patients with risk of breast cancer, using unsupervised and supervised 
      machine learning techniques, which characterizes the methodology as hybrid. The 
      dynamic infrared thermography monitors or quantitatively measures temperature 
      changes on the examined surface, after a thermal stress. In the dynamic infrared 
      thermography execution, a sequence of breast thermograms is generated. In the 
      proposed methodology, this sequence is processed and analyzed by several techniques. 
      First, the region of the breasts is segmented and the thermograms of the sequence 
      are registered. Then, temperature time series are built and the k-means algorithm is 
      applied on these series using various values of k. Clustering formed by k-means 
      algorithm, for each k value, is evaluated using clustering validation indices, 
      generating values treated as features in the classification model construction step. 
      A data mining tool was used to solve the combined algorithm selection and 
      hyperparameter optimization (CASH) problem in classification tasks. Besides the 
      classification algorithm recommended by the data mining tool, classifiers based on 
      Bayesian networks, neural networks, decision rules and decision tree were executed 
      on the data set used for evaluation. Test results support that the proposed analysis 
      methodology is able to indicate patients with breast cancer. Among 39 tested 
      classification algorithms, K-Star and Bayes Net presented 100% classification 
      accuracy. Furthermore, among the Bayes Net, multi-layer perceptron, decision table 
      and random forest classification algorithms, an average accuracy of 95.38% was 
      obtained.

TI  - Global Transcriptional Response of Human Liver Cells to Ethanol Stress of Different 
      Strength Reveals Hormetic Behavior.
PG  - 883-894
LID - 10.1111/acer.13361 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The liver is the major site for alcohol metabolism in the body and 
      therefore the primary target organ for ethanol (EtOH)-induced toxicity. In this 
      study, we investigated the in vitro response of human liver cells to different EtOH 
      concentrations in a perfused bioartificial liver device that mimics the complex 
      architecture of the natural organ. METHODS: Primary human liver cells were cultured 
      in the bioartificial liver device and treated for 24 hours with medium containing 
      150 mM (low), 300 mM (medium), or 600 mM (high) EtOH, while a control culture was 
      kept untreated. Gene expression patterns for each EtOH concentration were monitored 
      using Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Gene chips. Scaled expression profiles of 
      differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were clustered using Fuzzy c-means algorithm. 
      In addition, functional classification methods, KEGG pathway mapping and also a 
      machine learning approach (Random Forest) were utilized. RESULTS: A number of 966 
      (150 mM EtOH), 1,334 (300 mM EtOH), or 4,132 (600 mM EtOH) genes were found to be 
      differentially expressed. Dose-response relationships of the identified clusters of 
      co-expressed genes showed a monotonic, threshold, or nonmonotonic (hormetic) 
      behavior. Functional classification of DEGs revealed that low or medium EtOH 
      concentrations operate adaptation processes, while alterations observed for the high 
      EtOH concentration reflect the response to cellular damage. The genes displaying a 
      hormetic response were functionally characterized by overrepresented "cellular 
      ketone metabolism" and "carboxylic acid metabolism." Altered expression of the genes 
      BAHD1 and H3F3B was identified as sufficient to classify the samples according to 
      the applied EtOH doses. CONCLUSIONS: Different pathways of metabolic and epigenetic 
      regulation are affected by EtOH exposition and partly undergo hormetic regulation in 
      the bioartificial liver device. Gene expression changes observed at high EtOH 
      concentrations reflect in some aspects the situation of alcoholic hepatitis in 
      humans.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a complex disorder that is traditionally 
      stratified based on clinical signs and symptoms. Recent imaging and molecular 
      biomarker innovations provide unprecedented opportunities for improved TBI precision 
      medicine, incorporating patho-anatomical and molecular mechanisms. Complete 
      integration of these diverse data for TBI diagnosis and patient stratification 
      remains an unmet challenge. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The Transforming Research and 
      Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury (TRACK-TBI) Pilot multicenter study 
      enrolled 586 acute TBI patients and collected diverse common data elements 
      (TBI-CDEs) across the study population, including imaging, genetics, and clinical 
      outcomes. We then applied topology-based data-driven discovery to identify natural 
      subgroups of patients, based on the TBI-CDEs collected. Our hypothesis was two-fold: 
      1) A machine learning tool known as topological data analysis (TDA) would reveal 
      data-driven patterns in patient outcomes to identify candidate biomarkers of 
      recovery, and 2) TDA-identified biomarkers would significantly predict patient 
      outcome recovery after TBI using more traditional methods of univariate statistical 
      tests. TDA algorithms organized and mapped the data of TBI patients in 
      multidimensional space, identifying a subset of mild TBI patients with a specific 
      multivariate phenotype associated with unfavorable outcome at 3 and 6 months after 
      injury. Further analyses revealed that this patient subset had high rates of 
      post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and enrichment in several distinct genetic 
      polymorphisms associated with cellular responses to stress and DNA damage (PARP1), 
      and in striatal dopamine processing (ANKK1, COMT, DRD2). CONCLUSIONS: TDA identified 
      a unique diagnostic subgroup of patients with unfavorable outcome after mild TBI 
      that were significantly predicted by the presence of specific genetic polymorphisms. 
      Machine learning methods such as TDA may provide a robust method for patient 
      stratification and treatment planning targeting identified biomarkers in future 
      clinical trials in TBI patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier 
      NCT01565551.

PG  - 452-460
LID - 10.3414/ME16-02-0051 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The understanding of how stress influences health behavior can provide 
      insights into developing healthy lifestyle interventions. This understanding is 
      traditionally attained through observational studies that examine associations at a 
      population level. This nomothetic approach, however, is fundamentally limited by the 
      fact that the environment- person milieu that constitutes stress exposure and 
      experience can vary substantially between individuals, and the modifiable elements 
      of these exposures and experiences are individual-specific. With recent advances in 
      smartphone and sensing technologies, it is now possible to conduct idiographic 
      assessment in users' own environment, leveraging the full-range observations of 
      actions and experiences that result in differential response to naturally occurring 
      events. The aim of this paper is to explore the hypothesis that an ideographic 
      N-of-1 model can better capture an individual's stress- behavior pathway (or the 
      lack thereof) and provide useful person-specific predictors of exercise behavior. 
      METHODS: This paper used the data collected in an observational study in 79 
      participants who were followed for up to a 1-year period, wherein their physical 
      activity was continuously and objectively monitored by actigraphy and their stress 
      experience was recorded via ecological momentary assessment on a mobile app. In 
      addition, our analyses considered exogenous and environmental variables retrieved 
      from public archive such as day in a week, daylight time, temperature and 
      precipitation. Leveraging the multiple data sources, we developed prediction 
      algorithms for exercise behavior using random forest and classification tree 
      techniques using a nomothetic approach and an N-of-1 approach. The two approaches 
      were compared based on classification errors in predicting personalized exercise 
      behavior. RESULTS: Eight factors were selected by random forest for the nomothetic 
      decision model, which was used to predict whether a participant would exercise on a 
      particular day. The predictors included previous exercise behavior, emotional 
      factors (e.g., midday stress), external factors such as weather (e.g., temperature), 
      and self-determination factors (e.g., expectation of exercise). The nomothetic model 
      yielded an average classification error of 36%. The ideographic N-of-1 models used 
      on average about two predictors for each individual, and had an average 
      classification error of 25%, which represented an improvement of 11 percentage 
      points. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the traditional one-size-fits-all, nomothetic model 
      that generalizes population-evidence for individuals, the proposed N-of-1 model can 
      better capture the individual difference in their stressbehavior pathways. In this 
      paper, we demonstrate it is feasible to perform personalized exercise behavior 
      prediction, mainly made possible by mobile health technology and machine learning 
      analytics.

AB  - RATIONALE: Sedation, dependence, and abuse liability limit the use of non-selective 
      γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A)) receptor positive modulators for the treatment of 
      anxiety. AZD7325 and AZD6280 are novel, subtype-selective GABA(Aα2,3) receptor 
      positive modulators with limited sedative effects. OBJECTIVES: The current study 
      aimed to confirm target engagement at GABA(A) receptors by AZD7325 and AZD6280 in 
      humans and to determine the relationship between exposure, GABA(A) receptor 
      occupancy, and tolerability. METHOD: Two PET studies, using high-resolution research 
      tomography (HRRT) and the radioligand [(11)C]flumazenil, were performed in 12 
      subjects at baseline and after administration of single oral doses of AZD7325 (0.2 
      to 30 mg) and AZD6280 (5 to 40 mg). PET images were analyzed using a simplified 
      reference tissue model, and regional binding potentials (BP(ND)) were obtained. The 
      relationship between plasma concentration of AZD7325 or AZD6280 and GABA(A) receptor 
      occupancy was described by hyperbolic function, and K (i,plasma) (plasma 
      concentration required for 50% receptor occupancy) was estimated. Assessments of 
      safety and tolerability included recording of adverse events, vital signs, 
      electrocardiogram, and laboratory tests. RESULTS: The [(11)C]flumazenil binding was 
      reduced in a dose-dependent, saturable manner by both agents. Maximum receptor 
      occupancy could be reached for both compounds without causing sedation or cognitive 
      impairment. The K (i,plasma) estimates for AZD7325 and AZD6280 were 15 and 
      440 nmol/l, respectively. CONCLUSION: High GABA(A) receptor occupancy by AZD7325 and 
      AZD6280 could be reached without clear sedative effects.

AB  - In a climate change scenario, successful modeling of the relationships between 
      plant-soil-meteorology is crucial for a sustainable agricultural production, 
      especially for perennial crops. Grapevines (Vitis vinifera L. cv Chardonnay) located 
      in eight experimental plots (Burgundy, France) along a hillslope were monitored 
      weekly for 3 years for leaf water potentials, both at predawn (Ψpd) and at midday 
      (Ψstem). The water stress experienced by grapevine was modeled as a function of 
      meteorological data (minimum and maximum temperature, rainfall) and soil 
      characteristics (soil texture, gravel content, slope) by a gradient boosting 
      machine. Model performance was assessed by comparison with carbon isotope 
      discrimination (δ(13)C) of grape sugars at harvest and by the use of a test-set. The 
      developed models reached outstanding prediction performance (RMSE < 0.08 MPa for 
      Ψstem and < 0.06 MPa for Ψpd), comparable to measurement accuracy. Model predictions 
      at a daily time step improved correlation with δ(13)C data, respect to the observed 
      trend at a weekly time scale. The role of each predictor in these models was 
      described in order to understand how temperature, rainfall, soil texture, gravel 
      content and slope affect the grapevine water status in the studied context. This 
      work proposes a straight-forward strategy to simulate plant water stress in field 
      condition, at a local scale; to investigate ecological relationships in the vineyard 
      and adapt cultural practices to future conditions.

TI  - Investigating the neural mechanisms of aware and unaware fear memory with FMRI.
LID - 3083 [pii]
LID - 10.3791/3083 [doi]
AB  - Pavlovian fear conditioning is often used in combination with functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans to investigate the neural substrates of 
      associative learning. In these studies, it is important to provide behavioral 
      evidence of conditioning to verify that differences in brain activity are 
      learning-related and correlated with human behavior. Fear conditioning studies often 
      monitor autonomic responses (e.g. skin conductance response; SCR) as an index of 
      learning and memory. In addition, other behavioral measures can provide valuable 
      information about the learning process and/or other cognitive functions that 
      influence conditioning. For example, the impact unconditioned stimulus (UCS) 
      expectancies have on the expression of the conditioned response (CR) and 
      unconditioned response (UCR) has been a topic of interest in several recent studies. 
      SCR and UCS expectancy measures have recently been used in conjunction with fMRI to 
      investigate the neural substrates of aware and unaware fear learning and memory 
      processes. Although these cognitive processes can be evaluated to some degree 
      following the conditioning session, post-conditioning assessments cannot measure 
      expectations on a trial-to-trial basis and are susceptible to interference and 
      forgetting, as well as other factors that may distort results. Monitoring autonomic 
      and behavioral responses simultaneously with fMRI provides a mechanism by which the 
      neural substrates that mediate complex relationships between cognitive processes and 
      behavioral/autonomic responses can be assessed. However, monitoring autonomic and 
      behavioral responses in the MRI environment poses a number of practical problems. 
      Specifically, 1) standard behavioral and physiological monitoring equipment is 
      constructed of ferrous material that cannot be safely used near the MRI scanner, 2) 
      when this equipment is placed outside of the MRI scanning chamber, the cables 
      projecting to the subject can carry RF noise that produces artifacts in brain 
      images, 3) artifacts can be produced within the skin conductance signal by switching 
      gradients during scanning, 4) the fMRI signal produced by the motor demands of 
      behavioral responses may need to be distinguished from activity related to the 
      cognitive processes of interest. Each of these issues can be resolved with 
      modifications to the setup of physiological monitoring equipment and additional data 
      analysis procedures. Here we present a methodology to simultaneously monitor 
      autonomic and behavioral responses during fMRI, and demonstrate the use of these 
      methods to investigate aware and unaware memory processes during fear conditioning.

AB  - Sleep disturbance is common in chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). 
      However, prior work has demonstrated that there are inconsistencies between 
      subjective and objective assessments of sleep disturbance in PTSD. Therefore, we 
      investigated whether subjective or objective sleep assessment has greater clinical 
      utility to differentiate PTSD patients from healthy subjects. Further, we evaluated 
      whether the combination of subjective and objective methods improves the accuracy of 
      classification into patient versus healthy groups, which has important diagnostic 
      implications. We recruited 32 chronic war-induced PTSD patients and 32 age- and 
      gender-matched healthy subjects to participate in this study. Subjective (i.e. from 
      three self-reported sleep questionnaires) and objective sleep-related data (i.e. 
      from actigraphy scores) were collected from each participant. Subjective, objective, 
      and combined (subjective and objective) sleep data were then analyzed using support 
      vector machine classification. The classification accuracy, sensitivity, and 
      specificity for subjective variables were 89.2%, 89.3%, and 89%, respectively. The 
      classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for objective variables were 
      65%, 62.3%, and 67.8%, respectively. The classification accuracy, sensitivity, and 
      specificity for the aggregate variables (combination of subjective and objective 
      variables) were 91.6%, 93.0%, and 90.3%, respectively. Our findings indicate that 
      classification accuracy using subjective measurements is superior to objective 
      measurements and the combination of both assessments appears to improve the 
      classification accuracy for differentiating PTSD patients from healthy individuals.

TI  - 0Phobia - towards a virtual cure for acrophobia: study protocol for a randomized 
      controlled trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) has been shown to be as 
      effective as traditional forms of in vivo exposure therapy for the treatment of 
      specific phobias. However, as with in vivo exposure, VRET still involves relatively 
      high costs and limited accessibility which makes it prohibitive for a large part of 
      the population. Innovative methods using smartphone applications (apps) may improve 
      accessibility and scalability of VRET. The aim of this study is to evaluate 0Phobia, 
      a gamified self-guided VRET for acrophobia that is delivered through a smartphone 
      app in combination with rudimentary cardboard virtual reality (VR) goggles. 
      METHODS/DESIGN: Participants (N = 180, aged 18-65 years) with acrophobia symptoms 
      will be recruited from the Dutch general population and randomized to either 0Phobia 
      (n = 90) or a waitlist control condition (n = 90). 0Phobia will be delivered over a 
      period of 3 weeks and includes psychoeducation, VR exposure, cognitive techniques, 
      monitoring of symptoms, and relapse prevention. The primary outcome measure will be 
      the Acrophobia Questionnaire. Secondary outcome measures will include 
      user-friendliness, symptoms of anxiety, depression, and mastery. Assessments will 
      take place online at baseline, directly after the intervention (post test) and at 
      follow-up (3 months). DISCUSSION: This study capitalizes on novel technology and 
      recent scientific advances to develop an affordable and scalable treatment modality.

TI  - Comparison of the Factor Structure of the Patient Health Questionnaire for Somatic 
      Symptoms (PHQ-15) in Germany, the Netherlands, and China. A Transcultural Structural 
      Equation Modeling (SEM) Study.

AB  - Background: Persistent somatic symptoms are associated with psychological distress, 
      impaired function, and medical help-seeking behavior. The Patient Health 
      Questionnaire (PHQ)-15 is used as a screening instrument for somatization and as a 
      monitoring instrument for somatic symptom severity. A bifactorial model has been 
      described, with one general factor and four orthogonal specific symptom factors. The 
      objective of the present study was to assess and to clarify the factor structure of 
      the PHQ-15 within and between different countries in Western Europe and China. 
      Method: Cross-sectional secondary data analysis performed in three patient data 
      samples from two Western European countries (Germany N = 2,517, the Netherlands N = 
      456) and from China (N = 1,329). Confirmatory factor analyses (CFA), and structural 
      equation modeling (SEM) analysis were performed. Results: The general factor is 
      found in every sample. However, although the outcomes of the PHQ-15 estimate 
      severity of somatic symptoms in different facets, these subscales may have different 
      meanings in the European and Chinese setting. Replication of the factorial structure 
      was possible in the German and Dutch datasets but not in the dataset from China. For 
      the Chinese dataset, a bifactorial model with a different structure for the 
      cardiopulmonary factor is suggested. The PHQ-15 could discern somatization from 
      anxiety and depression within the three samples. Conclusion: The PHQ-15 is a valid 
      questionnaire that can discern somatization from anxiety and depression within 
      different cultures like Europe or China. It can be fitted to a bifactorial model for 
      categorical data, however, the model can only be recommended for use of the general 
      factor. Application of the orthogonal subscales in non-European samples is not 
      corroborated by the results. The differences cannot be ascribed to differences in 
      health care settings or by differences in concomitant depression or anxiety but 
      instead, a cultural factor involving concepts of disease may play a role in this as 
      they may play a role in the translation of the questionnaire. Further research is 
      needed to explore this, and replication studies are needed regarding the factorial 
      structure of the PHQ-15 in China.

TI  - The Feasibility of Embedding Data Collection into the Routine Service Delivery of a 
      Multi-Component Program for High-Risk Young People.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph14020208 [doi]
LID - 208
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is little evidence about how to improve outcomes for high-risk 
      young people, of whom Indigenous young people are disproportionately represented, 
      due to few evaluation studies of interventions. One way to increase the evidence is 
      to have researchers and service providers collaborate to embed evaluation into the 
      routine delivery of services, so program delivery and evaluation occur 
      simultaneously. This study aims to demonstrate the feasibility of integrating 
      best-evidence measures into the routine data collection processes of a service for 
      high-risk young people, and identify the number and nature of risk factors 
      experienced by participants. METHODS: The youth service is a rural based NGO 
      comprised of multiple program components: (i) engagement activities; (ii) case 
      management; (iii) diversionary activities; (iv) personal development; and (v) 
      learning and skills. A best-evidence assessment tool was developed by staff and 
      researchers and embedded into the service's existing intake procedure. Assessment 
      items were organised into demographic characteristics and four domains of risk: 
      education and employment; health and wellbeing; substance use; and crime. 
      Descriptive data are presented and summary risk variables were created for each 
      domain of risk. A count of these summary variables represented the number of 
      co-occurring risks experienced by each participant. The feasibility of this process 
      was determined by the proportion of participants who completed the intake assessment 
      and provided research consent. RESULTS: This study shows 85% of participants 
      completed the assessment tool demonstrating that data on participant risk factors 
      can feasibly be collected by embedding a best-evidence assessment tool into the 
      routine data collection processes of a service. The most prevalent risk factors were 
      school absence, unemployment, suicide ideation, mental distress, substance use, low 
      levels of physical activity, low health service utilisation, and involvement in 
      crime or with the juvenile justice system. All but one participant experienced at 
      least two co-occurring domains of risk, and the majority of participants (58%) 
      experienced co-occurring risk across four domains. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first 
      study to demonstrate that best-evidence measures can feasibly be embedded into the 
      routine data collection processes of a service for high-risk young people. This 
      process allows services to tailor their activities to the most prevalent risks 
      experienced by participants, and monitor these risks over time. Replication of this 
      process in other services would improve the quality of services, facilitate more 
      high quality evaluations of services, and contribute evidence on how to improve 
      outcomes for high-risk young people.

TI  - Appraisal of breast cancer symptoms by Iranian women: entangled cognitive, emotional 
      and socio-cultural responses.
PG  - 8135-42
AB  - BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the most common cancer in Iranian women and usually 
      features delayed presentation and late diagnosis. Interpretation of symptoms, as the 
      most important step, has a significant impact on patient delay in seeking treatment. 
      There is a dearth of studies on symptom appraisal and the process leading to seeking 
      help in breast cancer patients. This study explored the perceptions and experiences 
      of Iranian women with self-detected possible breast cancer symptoms. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: A qualitative method was conducted involving in-depth semi-structured 
      interviews with 27 Iranian women with self-discovered breast cancer symptoms. 
      Participants were purposefully selected from women who attended Cancer Institute of 
      Tehran University of Medical Sciences during June 2012 to August 2013. The 
      audiotaped interviews were transcribed and analyzed using conventional content 
      analysis with MAXQDA soft ware version 10. The trustworthiness of the study was 
      verified by prolonged engagement, member validation of codes, and thick description. 
      RESULTS: The main concepts emerging from data analysis were categorized in four 
      categories: symptom recognition, labeling of symptoms, interactive understanding, 
      and confronting the fear of cancer. Symptom recognition through breast 
      self-examination, symptom monitoring and employing prior knowledge distinguished 
      normal from abnormal symptoms and accompanied with perception of being at risk of 
      breast cancer led to symptom labeling. Social interaction by selective disclosure 
      and receiving reassurance from a consultant led to confirmation or redefinition of 
      the situation. Perceived seriousness of the situation and social meanings of breast 
      cancer as a stigmatized and incurable illness associated with loss of femininity 
      were reasons for patient worries and fear. CONCLUSIONS: This study emphasized that 
      entangled cognitive, emotional and socio-cultural responses affecting understanding 
      of symptom seriousness require further investigation. It is suggested that programs 
      aimed at shortening patient delay in breast cancer should be focused on improving 
      women's knowledge and self-awareness of breast cancer, in addition to correcting 
      their social beliefs.

TI  - Phenomapping for the Identification of Hypertensive Patients with the Myocardial 
      Substrate for Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction.
PG  - 275-284
LID - 10.1007/s12265-017-9739-z [doi]
AB  - We sought to evaluate whether unbiased machine learning of dense phenotypic data 
      ("phenomapping") could identify distinct hypertension subgroups that are associated 
      with the myocardial substrate (i.e., abnormal cardiac mechanics) for heart failure 
      with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). In the HyperGEN study, a population- and 
      family-based study of hypertension, we studied 1273 hypertensive patients utilizing 
      clinical, laboratory, and conventional echocardiographic phenotyping of the study 
      participants. We used machine learning analysis of 47 continuous phenotypic 
      variables to identify mutually exclusive groups constituting a novel classification 
      of hypertension. The phenomapping analysis classified study participants into 2 
      distinct groups that differed markedly in clinical characteristics, cardiac 
      structure/function, and indices of cardiac mechanics (e.g., phenogroup #2 had a 
      decreased absolute longitudinal strain [12.8 ± 4.1 vs. 14.6 ± 3.5%] even after 
      adjustment for traditional comorbidities [p < 0.001]). The 2 hypertension

AB  - The use of adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) in neurobehavioral research is rapidly 
      expanding. The present large-scale study applied the newest video-tracking and 
      data-mining technologies to further examine zebrafish anxiety-like phenotypes. Here, 
      we generated temporal and spatial three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of 
      zebrafish locomotion, globally assessed behavioral profiles evoked by several 
      anxiogenic and anxiolytic manipulations, mapped individual endpoints to 3D 
      reconstructions, and performed cluster analysis to reconfirm behavioral correlates 
      of high- and low-anxiety states. The application of 3D swim path reconstructions 
      consolidates behavioral data (while increasing data density) and provides a novel 
      way to examine and represent zebrafish behavior. It also enables rapid optimization 
      of video tracking settings to improve quantification of automated parameters, and 
      suggests that spatiotemporal organization of zebrafish swimming activity can be 
      affected by various experimental manipulations in a manner predicted by their 
      anxiolytic or anxiogenic nature. Our approach markedly enhances the power of 
      zebrafish behavioral analyses, providing innovative framework for high-throughput 3D 
      phenotyping of adult zebrafish behavior.

TI  - LipidHunter Identifies Phospholipids by High-Throughput Processing of LC-MS and 
      Shotgun Lipidomics Datasets.
PG  - 8800-8807
LID - 10.1021/acs.analchem.7b01126 [doi]
AB  - Lipids are dynamic constituents of biological systems, rapidly responding to any 
      changes in physiological conditions. Thus, there is a large interest in 
      lipid-derived markers for diagnostic and prognostic applications, especially in 
      translational and systems medicine research. As lipid identification remains a 
      bottleneck of modern untargeted lipidomics, we developed LipidHunter, a new open 
      source software for the high-throughput identification of phospholipids in data 
      acquired by LC-MS and shotgun experiments. LipidHunter resembles a workflow of 
      manual spectra annotation. Lipid identification is based on MS/MS data analysis in 
      accordance with defined fragmentation rules for each phospholipid (PL) class. The 
      software tool matches product and neutral loss signals obtained by collision-induced 
      dissociation to a user-defined white list of fatty acid residues and PL 
      class-specific fragments. The identified signals are tested against elemental 
      composition and bulk identification provided via LIPID MAPS search. Furthermore, 
      LipidHunter provides information-rich tabular and graphical reports allowing to 
      trace back key identification steps and perform data quality control. Thereby, 202 
      discrete lipid species were identified in lipid extracts from rat primary 
      cardiomyocytes treated with a peroxynitrite donor. Their relative quantification 
      allowed the monitoring of dynamic reconfiguration of the cellular lipidome in 
      response to mild nitroxidative stress. LipidHunter is available free for download at 
      https://bitbucket.org/SysMedOs/lipidhunter .

TI  - A Quality Improvement Approach to Perineal Skin Care: Using Standardized Guidelines 
      and Novel Diaper Wipes to Reduce Diaper Dermatitis in NICU Infants.
LID - 10.1097/ANC.0000000000000795 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diaper dermatitis (DD) causes discomfort and emotional distress and 
      creates possible sources of infection among newborn intensive care unit infants. 
      Diaper dermatitis remains prevalent despite studies documenting an understanding of 
      prevention and treatment modalities. Standardizing perineal skin care guidelines 
      could reduce DD. PURPOSE: Implement perineal skin care guidelines, while introducing 
      novel diaper wipes, to decrease the incidence of DD by 20% within a 1-year period. 
      METHODS: Our unit reviewed evidence-based literature to develop a standardized 
      perineal care guideline for prevention and treatment, encompassing the use of novel, 
      preservative-free diaper wipes with grapefruit seed extract. The outcome measures 
      were the incidence and duration of DD. Process compliances were monitored. The 
      balancing measure was the rate of fungal skin infection while using 
      preservative-free wipes. FINDINGS: Between July 2017 and March 2019, 1070 infants 
      were admitted for 1 or more days, with 11% of those being born at less than 30 weeks 
      of gestational age. After guideline implementation in January 2018, the incidence of 
      DD decreased by 16.7%. The incidence of severe cases dropped by 34.9%, with 3.5 days 
      per 100 patient-days shortened duration. Process compliance was achieved. Neonates 
      tolerated the novel wipes without increased fungal skin infection. IMPLICATIONS FOR 
      PRACTICE: The Perineal Skin Care Guidelines could reduce the rate and duration of 
      DD. Newborn intensive care unit infants tolerated the novel diaper wipes. 
      IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: Additional research on wipes containing other types of 
      extracts or ingredients.

TI  - Patients' and Health Care Providers' Perception of Stressors in the Intensive Care 
      Units.
PG  - 205-14
LID - 10.1097/DCC.0000000000000121 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purposes of this study is first, to investigate intensive care 
      patients' perceptions of stressors; second, to investigate the health care 
      provider's perception of what constitutes a stressor from the patient's perspective; 
      and third, to describe how health care providers manage their patients' stressors. 
      This was a mixed-methods study; the quantitative section replicated Cornock's 1998 
      study of stress in the intensive care unit (ICU), with difference in sampling to 
      include all health care providers in the ICU, in addition to nurses. The qualitative 
      section added information to the current literature by describing how health care 
      providers manage their patient's stressors. This article reports the quantitative 
      findings of this study, as the qualitative section is presented in a separate 
      article. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE: It is important to describe ICU patients' 
      stressful experiences to assess patient's stressors, provide holistic care to 
      eliminate stressors, and provide feedback to health care providers. There is a need 
      to describe the clinical practice related to stress perception and management of 
      stressors in the critical care environment. METHODOLOGY: A mixed-methods comparative 
      descriptive design was used for the quantitative section, and a phenomenological 
      approach guided the qualitative section. Lazarus and Folkman's theory formed the 
      bases for integrating all variables investigated in this study. The sample included 
      70 ICU patients and 70 ICU health care providers. After consenting to participate in 
      this study, subjects were given a demographic form and a paper-based tool, the 
      Environmental Stressors graphic data form Questionnaire. Questionnaires were filled 
      out by subjects anonymously in the ICU and returned to the researcher in the same 
      setting. FINDINGS: Descriptive statistics were analyzed using SPSS data analysis 
      software. The top 3 most stressful items ranked by the patients included "being in 
      pain," followed by "not being able to sleep" and "financial worries"; on the other 
      hand, health care providers perceived "being in pain" followed by "not being able to 
      communicate" and "not being in control of yourself" as the top 3 stressors perceived 
      by their patients. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The findings of this study are crucial 
      and may inform nursing assessments and care of the ICU patient. In addition, this 
      information may encourage the ICU staff to manipulate and redesign the ICU 
      environment to be less stressful. Also, the findings of this study guided the 
      development of an ICU stressor control policy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Long-term continuous systolic blood pressure (SBP) and heart rate (HR) 
      monitors are of tremendous value to medical (cardiovascular, circulatory and 
      cerebrovascular management), wellness (emotional and stress tracking) and fitness 
      (performance monitoring) applications, but face several major impediments, such as 
      poor wearability, lack of widely accepted robust SBP models and insufficient 
      proofing of the generalization ability of calibrated models. METHODS: This paper 
      proposes a wearable cuff-less electrocardiography (ECG) and photoplethysmogram 
      (PPG)-based SBP and HR monitoring system and many efforts are made focusing on above 
      challenges. Firstly, both ECG/PPG sensors are integrated into a single-arm band to 
      provide a super wearability. A highly convenient but challenging single-lead 
      configuration is proposed for weak single-arm-ECG acquisition, instead of placing 
      the electrodes on the chest, or two wrists. Secondly, to identify heartbeats and 
      estimate HR from the motion artifacts-sensitive weak arm-ECG, a machine 
      learning-enabled framework is applied. Then ECG-PPG heartbeat pairs are determined 
      for pulse transit time (PTT) measurement. Thirdly, a PTT&HR-SBP model is applied for 
      SBP estimation, which is also compared with many PTT-SBP models to demonstrate the 
      necessity to introduce HR information in model establishment. Fourthly, the fitted 
      SBP models are further evaluated on the unseen data to illustrate the generalization 
      ability. A customized hardware prototype was established and a dataset collected 
      from ten volunteers was acquired to evaluate the proof-of-concept system. RESULTS: 
      The semi-customized prototype successfully acquired from the left upper arm the PPG 
      signal, and the weak ECG signal, the amplitude of which is only around 10% of that 
      of the chest-ECG. The HR estimation has a mean absolute error (MAE) and a root mean 
      square error (RMSE) of only 0.21 and 1.20 beats per min, respectively. Through the 
      comparative analysis, the PTT&HR-SBP models significantly outperform the PTT-SBP 
      models. The testing performance is 1.63 ± 4.44, 3.68, 4.71 mmHg in terms of mean 
      error ± standard deviation, MAE and RMSE, respectively, indicating a good 
      generalization ability on the unseen fresh data. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed 
      proof-of-concept system is highly wearable, and its robustness is thoroughly 
      evaluated on different modeling strategies and also the unseen data, which are 
      expected to contribute to long-term pervasive hypertension, heart health and fitness 
      management.

TI  - Intensive Care Nurses' Belief Systems Regarding the Health Economics: A Focused 
      Ethnography.
PG  - 52939
LID - 10.5539/gjhs.v8n9p172 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Health care beliefs can have an effect on the efficiency and 
      effectiveness of nursing practices. Nevertheless, how belief systems impact on the 
      economic performance of intensive care unit (ICU) nurses is not known. This study 
      aimed to explore the ICU nurses' beliefs and their effect on nurse's practices and 
      behavior patterns regarding the health economics. METHODS: In this study, a focused 
      ethnography method was used. Twenty-four informants from ICU nurses and other 
      professional individuals were purposively selected and interviewed. As well, 400 
      hours of ethnographic observations were used for data collection. Data analysis was 
      performed using the methods described by Miles and Huberman (1994). FINDINGS: Eight 
      beliefs were found that gave meaning to ICU nurse's practices regarding the health 
      economics. 1. The registration of medications and supplies disrupt the nursing care; 
      2.Monitoring and auditing improve consumption; 3.There is a fear of possible 
      shortage in the future; 4.Supply and replacement of equipment is difficult; 5.Higher 
      prices lead to more accurate consumption; 6.The quality of care precedes the costs; 
      7. Clinical Guidelines are abundant but useful; and 8.Patient economy has priority 
      over hospital economy. Maintaining the quality of patient care with least attention 
      to hospital costs was the main focus of the beliefs formed up in the ICU regarding 
      the health economics. CONCLUSIONS: ICU nurses' belief systems have significantly 
      shaped in relation to providing a high-quality care. Although high quality of care 
      can lead to a rise in the effectiveness of nursing care, cost control perspective 
      should also be considered in planning for improve the quality of care. Therefore, it 
      is necessary to involve the ICU nurses in decision-making about unit cost 
      management. They must become familiar with the principles of heath care economics 
      and productivity by applying an effective cost management program. It may be optimal 
      to implement the reforms in various aspects, such as the hospital's strategic plan 
      and supply chain management system.

TI  - Behavioral Indicators on a Mobile Sensing Platform Predict Clinically Validated 
      Psychiatric Symptoms of Mood and Anxiety Disorders.
PG  - e75
LID - 10.2196/jmir.6678 [doi]
LID - e75
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a critical need for real-time tracking of behavioral indicators 
      of mental disorders. Mobile sensing platforms that objectively and noninvasively 
      collect, store, and analyze behavioral indicators have not yet been clinically 
      validated or scalable. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to report on models of 
      clinical symptoms for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression derived 
      from a scalable mobile sensing platform. METHODS: A total of 73 participants (67% 
      [49/73] male, 48% [35/73] non-Hispanic white, 33% [24/73] veteran status) who 
      reported at least one symptom of PTSD or depression completed a 12-week field trial. 
      Behavioral indicators were collected through the noninvasive mobile sensing platform 
      on participants' mobile phones. Clinical symptoms were measured through validated 
      clinical interviews with a licensed clinical social worker. A combination hypothesis 
      and data-driven approach was used to derive key features for modeling symptoms, 
      including the sum of outgoing calls, count of unique numbers texted, absolute 
      distance traveled, dynamic variation of the voice, speaking rate, and voice quality. 
      Participants also reported ease of use and data sharing concerns. RESULTS: 
      Behavioral indicators predicted clinically assessed symptoms of depression and PTSD 
      (cross-validated area under the curve [AUC] for depressed mood=.74, fatigue=.56, 
      interest in activities=.75, and social connectedness=.83). Participants reported 
      comfort sharing individual data with physicians (Mean 3.08, SD 1.22), mental health 
      providers (Mean 3.25, SD 1.39), and medical researchers (Mean 3.03, SD 1.36). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Behavioral indicators passively collected through a mobile sensing 
      platform predicted symptoms of depression and PTSD. The use of mobile sensing 
      platforms can provide clinically validated behavioral indicators in real time; 
      however, further validation of these models and this platform in large clinical 
      samples is needed.

TI  - High-throughput workflow for monitoring and mining bioprocess data and its 
      application to inferring the physiological response of Escherichia coli to 
      perturbations.
PG  - 7040-9
LID - 10.1128/AEM.05838-11 [doi]
AB  - Miniaturization and high-throughput screening are currently the focus of emerging 
      research areas such as systems biology and systems biotechnology. A 
      fluorescence-based screening assay for the online monitoring of oxygen and pH and a 
      numerical method to mine the resulting online process data are described. The assay 
      employs commercial phosphorescent oxygen- and pH-sensitive probes in standard 48- or 
      96-well plates on a plate reader equipped with a shaker. In addition to dual 
      parametric analysis of both pH and oxygen in a single well, the assay allows 
      monitoring of growth, as measured by absorbance. Validation of the assay is 
      presented and compared with commercially available plates equipped with optical 
      sensors for oxygen and pH. By using model-free fitting to the readily available 
      online measurements, the length and rate of each phase such as the duration of lag 
      and transition phase or acidification, growth, and oxygen consumption rates are 
      automatically detected. In total, nine physiological descriptors, which can be used 
      for further statistical and comparison analysis, are extracted from the pH, oxygen 
      partial pressure (pO(2)), and optical density (OD) profiles. The combination of a 
      simple mix-and-measure procedure with an automatic data mining method allows high 
      sample throughput and good reproducibility while providing a physiological state 
      identification and characterization of test cells. As a proof of concept, the 
      utility of the workflow in assessing the physiological response of Escherichia coli 
      to environmental and genetic perturbations is demonstrated.

TI  - Leptin and Physical Activity in Adult Patients with Anorexia Nervosa: Failure to 
      Demonstrate a Simple Linear Association.
LID - 10.3390/nu9111210 [doi]
LID - 1210
AB  - High physical activity (PA) in patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) is hypothesized 
      to be, at least in part, a consequence of hypoleptinemia. However, most studies on 
      the association of leptin and PA in AN were performed in adolescents or young 
      adults, and PA was generally measured with subjective tools. We aimed to explore the 
      association of leptin and PA in adults with AN using an objective technique to 
      quantify PA. Using a cross-sectional, observational design, we analyzed body fat 
      (bioelectrical impedance), PA (accelerometry, SenseWear™ armband) and plasma leptin 
      (ELISA) in 61 women with AN (median age: 25 years, range: 18-52 years; median BMI: 
      14.8 ± 2.0 kg/m²) at the start of hospitalization. Results indicated a mean step 
      count per day of 12,841 ± 6408 (range: 3956-37,750). Leptin was closely associated 
      with BMI and body fat (ρ = 0.508 and ρ = 0.669, p < 0.001), but not with steps (ρ = 
      0.015, p = 0.908). Moreover, no significant association was observed between BMI and 
      steps (ρ = 0.189, p = 0.146). In conclusion, there was no simple, linear association 
      of leptin and PA, highlighting the need for more complex and non-linear models to 
      analyze the association of leptin and PA in adults with AN in future studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Applications of natural language processing to mental health notes are 
      not common given the sensitive nature of the associated narratives. The CEGS N-GRID 
      2016 Shared Task in Clinical Natural Language Processing (NLP) changed this scenario 
      by providing the first set of neuropsychiatric notes to participants. This study 
      summarizes our efforts and results in proposing a novel data use case for this 
      dataset as part of the third track in this shared task. OBJECTIVE: We explore the 
      feasibility and effectiveness of predicting a set of common mental conditions a 
      patient has based on the short textual description of patient's history of present 
      illness typically occurring in the beginning of a psychiatric initial evaluation 
      note. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We clean and process the 1000 records made available 
      through the N-GRID clinical NLP task into a key-value dictionary and build a dataset 
      of 986 examples for which there is a narrative for history of present illness as 
      well as Yes/No responses with regards to presence of specific mental conditions. We 
      propose two independent deep neural network models: one based on convolutional 
      neural networks (CNN) and another based on recurrent neural networks with 
      hierarchical attention (ReHAN), the latter of which allows for interpretation of 
      model decisions. We conduct experiments to compare these methods to each other and 
      to baselines based on linear models and named entity recognition (NER). RESULTS: Our 
      CNN model with optimized thresholding of output probability estimates achieves best 
      overall mean micro-F score of 63.144% for 11 common mental conditions with 
      statistically significant gains (p<0.05) over all other models. The ReHAN model with 
      interpretable attention mechanism scored 61.904% mean micro-F1 score. Both models' 
      improvements over baseline models (support vector machines and NER) are 
      statistically significant. The ReHAN model additionally aids in interpretation of 
      the results by surfacing important words and sentences that lead to a particular 
      prediction for each instance. CONCLUSIONS: Although the history of present illness 
      is a short text segment averaging 300 words, it is a good predictor for a few 
      conditions such as anxiety, depression, panic disorder, and attention deficit 
      hyperactivity disorder. Proposed CNN and RNN models outperform baseline approaches 
      and complement each other when evaluating on a per-label basis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Comparative effectiveness research uses multiple tools, but lacks 
      outcome measures to assess large electronic medical records and claims data. 
      Aggregate changes in medications in response to clinical need may serve as a 
      surrogate outcome measure. We developed the Medication Recommendation Tracking Form 
      (MRTF) to record the frequency, types, and reasons for medication adjustments in 
      order to calculate Necessary Clinical Adjustments (NCAs), medication adjustments to 
      reduce symptoms, maximize treatment response, or address problematic side effects. 
      METHODS: The MRTF was completed at every visit for 482 adult patients in Bipolar 
      CHOICE, a 6-month randomized comparative effectiveness trial. RESULTS: Responders 
      had significantly fewer NCAs compared to non-responders. NCAs predicted subsequent 
      response status such that every additional NCA during the previous visit decreased a 
      patient's odds of response by approximately 30%. Patients with more severe symptoms 
      had a greater number of NCAs at the subsequent visit. Patients with a comorbid 
      anxiety disorder demonstrated a significantly higher rate of NCAs per month than 
      those without a comorbid anxiety disorder. Patients with greater frequency, 
      intensity, and interference of side effects had higher rates of NCAs. Participants 
      with fewer NCAs reported a higher quality of life and decreased functional 
      impairment. LIMITATIONS: The MRTF has not been examined in community clinic settings 
      and did not predict response more efficiently than the Clinical Global 
      Impression-Bipolar Version (CGI-BP). CONCLUSIONS: The MRTF is a feasible proxy of 
      clinical outcome, with implications for clinical training and decision-making. 
      Analyses of big data could use changes in medications as a surrogate outcome 
      measure.

PG  - 1-9

AB  - This study aimed to identify the predictive capacity of wellness questionnaires on 
      measures of training load using machine learning methods. The distributions of, and 
      dose-response between, wellness and other load measures were also examined, offering 
      insights into response patterns. Data (n= 14,109) were collated from an athlete 
      management systems platform (Catapult Sports, Melbourne, Australia) and were split 
      across three sports (cricket, rugby league and football) with data analysis 
      conducted in R (Version 3.4.3). Wellness (sleep quality, readiness to train, general 
      muscular soreness, fatigue, stress, mood, recovery rating and motivation) as the 
      dependent variable, and sRPE, sRPE-TL and markers of external load (total distance 
      and m.min(-1)) as independent variables were included for analysis. Classification 
      and regression tree models showed high cross-validated error rates across all sports 
      (i.e., > 0.89) and low model accuracy (i.e., < 5% of variance explained by each 
      model) with similar results demonstrated using random forest models. These results 
      suggest wellness items have limited predictive capacity in relation to internal and 
      external load measures. This result was consistent despite varying statistical 
      approaches (regression, classification and random forest models) and transformation 
      of wellness scores. These findings indicate practitioners should exercise caution 
      when interpreting and applying wellness responses.

TI  - Assessing the Availability of Users to Engage in Just-in-Time Intervention in the 
      Natural Environment.
PG  - 909-920
AB  - Wearable wireless sensors for health monitoring are enabling the design and delivery 
      of just-in-time interventions (JITI). Critical to the success of JITI is to time its 
      delivery so that the user is available to be engaged. We take a first step in 
      modeling users' availability by analyzing 2,064 hours of physiological sensor data 
      and 2,717 self-reports collected from 30 participants in a week-long field study. We 
      use delay in responding to a prompt to objectively measure availability. We compute 
      99 features and identify 30 as most discriminating to train a machine learning model 
      for predicting availability. We find that location, affect, activity type, stress, 
      time, and day of the week, play significant roles in predicting availability. We 
      find that users are least available at work and during driving, and most available 
      when walking outside. Our model finally achieves an accuracy of 74.7% in 10-fold 
      cross-validation and 77.9% with leave-one-subject-out.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The association between early exposure to ambient air pollution and 
      adverse pregnancy outcomes in China is unclear. This study will assess the risk of 
      early-life exposure to air pollutants in Beijing and explore the viability of 
      8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) as a biological indicator to assess oxidative 
      stress induced by early-life exposure to air pollution. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Here, 
      2500 women with singleton pregnancies and their infants will be recruited from the 
      Beijing Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital. We will collect nine types of biological 
      samples, including maternal serum, urine, placental tissue, umbilical cord tissue 
      and umbilical cord blood during all three trimesters. The air pollution data 
      (particulate matter (PM)2.5, PM10 and similar factors) will be recorded at official 
      fixed-site monitoring stations closest to where the pregnant women live. We plan to 
      assess the effect of air pollutants on adverse pregnancy outcomes and infant 
      respiratory and circulatory disease using Cox regression and competitive risk 
      analysis and explore possible critical windows of exposure during pregnancy using 
      daily pollutant concentrations averaged over various periods of pregnancy combined 
      with individual activity and physiological parameters. Maternal and umbilical cord 
      blood samples (1000 samples) will be randomly selected for 8-OHdG assays to assess 
      the correlation between exposures to air pollutants and oxidative stress. We will 
      determine whether air pollutant exposure or 8-OHdG levels are associated with 
      adverse pregnancy outcomes. SPSS and SAS statistical software will be used for data 
      analysis. Cox regression and competing risk analysis will be used to compute the HR 
      and population attributable risk. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This research protocol 
      has already been approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Beijing Obstetrics and 
      Gynecology Hospital. Written informed consent will be obtained from all study 
      participants prior to enrolment. The results will be published in peer-reviewed 
      journals or disseminated through conference presentations. TRIAL REGISTRATION 
      NUMBER: This study has been registered in WHO International Clinical Trial 
      Register-Chinese Clinical Trial Registry under registrationnumber 
      ChiCTR-ROC-16010181 (http :// www.chictr.org.cn / showproj.aspx ?proj=17328).

TI  - Telemedical versus conventional heart patient monitoring: a survey study with German 
      physicians.
PG  - 378-83
LID - 10.1017/S026646231300041X [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: In this study, we explored crucial factors that explain a person's 
      attitude toward and his or her assessment of telemedical systems. Special focus lies 
      on the link between the perspective of physicians (telemedicine users) and 
      technicians (telemedicine designers) to find potential barriers hindering the broad 
      application of telemedical systems in hospitals and doctors' offices. METHODS: A 
      survey among medical professionals (n = 34), technical professionals (n = 39), and a 
      control group (n = 44) was conducted. The collected data were assessed in terms of 
      domain knowledge, attitudes toward telemedicine, and potential implementation 
      barriers. RESULTS: Participants favored the conventional method over telemedical 
      monitoring in regards to privacy, security, and time efficiency. In contrast, 
      telemedicine was preferred with reference to efficiency of data analysis, long-term 
      care, and emergency adequacy. Significant differences between the professional 
      groups were found regarding perceived cost effectiveness, patients' compliance, 
      privacy protection, and false alarm sensitivity. Medical professionals exhibited the 
      most reluctance toward using telemedical treatments. CONCLUSIONS: The perceived 
      drawbacks are attributed to a general uncertainty about the reliability of 
      telemedical systems, in combination with concerns about personal data privacy, 
      security, and loss of control. The reported fear of not being able to correctly use 
      and handle the systems assumes a low usability of devices. To acquaint medical 
      professionals with the benefits and limitations of telemedical systems, 
      telemonitoring and tele-treatment should be included in the education of medical 
      personnel at an early stage.

TI  - Changes in Membrane Lipid Composition and Function Accompanying Chilling Injury in 
      Bell Peppers.
PG  - 167-178
LID - 10.1093/pcp/pcx171 [doi]
AB  - Bell peppers are vulnerable to low temperature (<7°C) and subject to chilling injury 
      (CI). To elucidate the relationship between cell membrane lipid composition and CI, 
      a membrane lipidomic approach was taken. In addition, we performed microstructural 
      analysis and low-field nuclear magnetic resonance to better understand CI. We also 
      monitored primary physiological metabolism parameters to explain lipidomics. Our 
      study indicated that cellular structure damage was more serious at 4°C, mostly 
      represented by damage to the plasmalemma and plastid degradation. Membrane lipidomic 
      data analysis reveals monogalactosyldiacylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, 
      phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidic acid as crucial biomarkers during CI. 
      Furthermore, the significant increase in proline, electrolyte leakage and 
      phospholipase D in chilled fruits also proved that membrane lipid metabolism is 
      involved in the response to low temperature stress. To our knowledge, this study is 
      the first attempt to describe the CI mechanisms in bell peppers based on membrane 
      lipidomics.

AB  - The physical, chemical and bioreactivity characteristics of fine particulate matter 
      (PM(2.5)) collected near (<1 km) two landfill sites and downwind urban sites were 
      investigated. The PM(2.5) concentrations were significantly higher in winter than 
      summer. Diurnal variations of PM(2.5) were recorded at both landfill sites. Soot 
      aggregate particles were identified near the landfill sites, which indicated that 
      combustion pollution due to landfill activities was a significant source. High 
      correlation coefficients (r) implied several inorganic elements and water-soluble 
      inorganic ions (vanadium (V), copper (Cu), chloride (Cl(-)), nitrate (NO(3)(-)), 
      sodium (Na) and potassium (K)) were positively associated with wind flow from the 
      landfill sites. Nevertheless, no significant correlations were also identified 
      between these components against DNA damage. Significant associations were observed 
      between DNA damage and some heavy metals such as cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb), and 
      total Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) during the summer. The insignificant 
      associations of DNA damage under increased wind frequency from landfills suggested 
      that the PM(2.5) loading from sources such as regional sources was possibly an 
      important contributing factor for DNA damage. This outcome warrants the further 
      development of effective and source-specific landfill management regulations for 
      particulate matter production control to the city.

TI  - Toward Joint Acquisition-Annotation of Images with Egocentric Devices for a 
      Lower-Cost Machine Learning Application to Apple Detection.
LID - 10.3390/s20154173 [doi]
LID - 4173
AB  - Since most computer vision approaches are now driven by machine learning, the 
      current bottleneck is the annotation of images. This time-consuming task is usually 
      performed manually after the acquisition of images. In this article, we assess the 
      value of various egocentric vision approaches in regard to performing joint 
      acquisition and automatic image annotation rather than the conventional two-step 
      process of acquisition followed by manual annotation. This approach is illustrated 
      with apple detection in challenging field conditions. We demonstrate the possibility 
      of high performance in automatic apple segmentation (Dice 0.85), apple counting (88 
      percent of probability of good detection, and 0.09 true-negative rate), and apple 
      localization (a shift error of fewer than 3 pixels) with eye-tracking systems. This 
      is obtained by simply applying the areas of interest captured by the egocentric 
      devices to standard, non-supervised image segmentation. We especially stress the 
      importance in terms of time of using such eye-tracking devices on head-mounted 
      systems to jointly perform image acquisition and automatic annotation. A gain of 
      time of over 10-fold by comparison with classical image acquisition followed by 
      manual image annotation is demonstrated.

AB  - Untargeted metabolomic approaches offer new opportunities for a deeper understanding 
      of the molecular events related to toxic exposure. This study proposes a metabolomic 
      investigation of biochemical alterations occurring in urine as a result of dioxin 
      toxicity. Urine samples were collected from Czech chemical workers submitted to 
      severe dioxin occupational exposure in a herbicide production plant in the late 
      1960s. Experiments were carried out with ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography 
      (UHPLC) coupled to high-resolution quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF) mass 
      spectrometry. A chemistry-driven feature selection was applied to focus on 
      steroid-related metabolites. Supervised multivariate data analysis allowed 
      biomarkers, mainly related to bile acids, to be highlighted. These results supported 
      the hypothesis of liver damage and oxidative stress for long-term dioxin toxicity. 
      As a second step of data analysis, the information gained from the urine analysis of 
      Victor Yushchenko after his poisoning was examined. A subset of relevant urinary 
      markers of acute dioxin toxicity from this extreme phenotype, including glucuro- and 
      sulfo-conjugated endogenous steroid metabolites and bile acids, was assessed for its 
      ability to detect long-term effects of exposure. The metabolomic strategy presented 
      in this work allowed the determination of metabolic patterns related to dioxin 
      effects in human and the discovery of highly predictive subsets of biologically 
      meaningful and clinically relevant compounds. These results are expected to provide 
      valuable information for a deeper understanding of the molecular events related to 
      dioxin toxicity. Furthermore, it presents an original methodology of data 
      dimensionality reduction by using extreme phenotype as a guide to select relevant 
      features prior to data modeling (biologically driven data reduction).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cancer-related fatigue and insomnia are common distressing symptoms and 
      may affect mood and performance status. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was 
      to describe fatigue, sleep, pain, mood, and performance status and the relationships 
      among these variables in 187 patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM) and 
      conduct an analysis using the correlates of fatigue. METHODS: Data were from 
      baseline measures from the study, using the Profile of Mood States and the 
      Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Fatigue to assess fatigue, the actigraph to 
      measure sleep, the Wong/Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale to assess pain, the Profile of 
      Mood States to assess mood, and the 6-minute walk test along with a back/leg/chest 
      dynamometer to test muscle strength to assess performance status. Data analysis 
      consisted of descriptive statistics, Pearson and Spearman ρ correlations, and 
      multiple regression analysis using fatigue as the dependent variable. All P values 
      were 2-sided, and P<.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Patients with newly 
      diagnosed MM presented with fatigue, pain, sleep and mood disturbances, and 
      diminished functional performance. The regression model, which included all of these 
      variables along with age, sex, and stage of disease, was statistically significant 
      with a large measure of effect. Mood was a significant individual contributor to the 
      model. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with MM, fatigue, pain, sleep, mood, and 
      functional performance are interrelated. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Interventions 
      are needed to decrease fatigue and pain and to improve sleep, mood, and functional 
      performance.

TI  - Effects of a multimodal preparation package on vital signs of patients waiting for 
      coronary angiography.
PG  - e17518
LID - e17518
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients waiting for coronary angiography are often anxious and worried, 
      experiencing considerable emotional problems before the procedure, which can result 
      in an increase in blood pressure (BP), heart rate, respiratory rate and the 
      myocardial oxygen demand. Such maladaptive responses may not only increase the 
      patients need for sedative drugs, but also could increase the length of post 
      angiography hospitalization. Therefore, it is important to implement some supportive 
      actions to decrease the patients' anxiety and to stabilize their vital signs before 
      coronary angiography. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the effects of a 
      multimodal preparation package on vital signs of patients undergoing coronary 
      angiography. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A matched trial was conducted on 66 patients 
      waiting for coronary angiography. Patients were assigned in intervention (n = 33) 
      and control (n = 33) groups. A multimodal preparation package was implemented in 
      intervention group, two hours before angiography. The data collection instrument 
      consisted of questions on demographic characteristics and a table for recording the 
      patients' vital signs including systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP), heart 
      rate, respiratory rate and body temperature. Vital signs were measured three times, 
      the day before angiography, 30 minutes before and 30 minutes after the angiography, 
      using a thermometer and a monitoring device. Data analysis was performed using the 
      Kolmogo-Smirnov test, t test and Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: From the total number 
      of 66 patients, the 63.3% were male and married. No significant differences were 
      observed between the mean of SBP and DBP and also the heart rate in the intervention 
      and control groups, on the day before angiography. However, the mean SBP and DBP and 
      heart rate of the intervention group were significantly lower compared to the 
      control group, both 30 minutes before and 30 minutes after angiography. The 
      intervention did not significantly change the respiration rate and temperature in 
      the intervention group. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that preparation package was 
      effective in decreasing SBP and DBP, as well as heart rate. Therefore, using 
      multimodal comprehensive preparation packages, such as the package used in the 
      present report, is suggested.

TI  - A Platform to Build Mobile Health Apps: The Personal Health Intervention Toolkit 
      (PHIT).
PG  - e46
LID - 10.2196/mhealth.4202 [doi]
LID - e46
AB  - Personal Health Intervention Toolkit (PHIT) is an advanced cross-platform software 
      framework targeted at personal self-help research on mobile devices. Following the 
      subjective and objective measurement, assessment, and plan methodology for health 
      assessment and intervention recommendations, the PHIT platform lets researchers 
      quickly build mobile health research Android and iOS apps. They can (1) create 
      complex data-collection instruments using a simple extensible markup language (XML) 
      schema; (2) use Bluetooth wireless sensors; (3) create targeted self-help 
      interventions based on collected data via XML-coded logic; (4) facilitate 
      cross-study reuse from the library of existing instruments and interventions such as 
      stress, anxiety, sleep quality, and substance abuse; and (5) monitor longitudinal 
      intervention studies via daily upload to a Web-based dashboard portal. For 
      physiological data, Bluetooth sensors collect real-time data with on-device 
      processing. For example, using the BinarHeartSensor, the PHIT platform processes the 
      heart rate data into heart rate variability measures, and plots these data as 
      time-series waveforms. Subjective data instruments are user data-entry screens, 
      comprising a series of forms with validation and processing logic. The PHIT 
      instrument library consists of over 70 reusable instruments for various domains 
      including cognitive, environmental, psychiatric, psychosocial, and substance abuse. 
      Many are standardized instruments, such as the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification 
      Test, Patient Health Questionnaire-8, and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist. 
      Autonomous instruments such as battery and global positioning system location 
      support continuous background data collection. All data are acquired using a 
      schedule appropriate to the app's deployment. The PHIT intelligent virtual advisor 
      (iVA) is an expert system logic layer, which analyzes the data in real time on the 
      device. This data analysis results in a tailored app of interventions and other 
      data-collection instruments. For example, if a user anxiety score exceeds a 
      threshold, the iVA might add a meditation intervention to the task list in order to 
      teach the user how to relax, and schedule a reassessment using the anxiety 
      instrument 2 weeks later to re-evaluate. If the anxiety score exceeds a higher 
      threshold, then an advisory to seek professional help would be displayed. Using the 
      easy-to-use PHIT scripting language, the researcher can program new instruments, the 
      iVA, and interventions to their domain-specific needs. The iVA, instruments, and 
      interventions are defined via XML files, which facilities rapid app development and 
      deployment. The PHIT Web-based dashboard portal provides the researcher access to 
      all the uploaded data. After a secure login, the data can be filtered by criteria 
      such as study, protocol, domain, and user. Data can also be exported into a 
      comma-delimited file for further processing. The PHIT framework has proven to be an 
      extensible, reconfigurable technology that facilitates mobile data collection and 
      health intervention research. Additional plans include instrument development in 
      other domains, additional health sensors, and a text messaging notification system.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Digital traces left on the Internet by web users, if properly aggregated 
      and analyzed, can represent a huge information dataset able to inform syndromic 
      surveillance systems in real time with data collected directly from individuals. 
      Since people use everyday language rather than medical jargon (e.g. runny nose vs. 
      respiratory distress), knowledge of patients' terminology is essential for the 
      mining of health related conversations on social networks. OBJECTIVES: In this paper 
      we present a methodology for early detection and analysis of epidemics based on 
      mining Twitter messages. In order to reliably trace messages of patients that 
      actually complain of a disease, first, we learn a model of naïve medical language, 
      second, we adopt a symptom-driven, rather than disease-driven, keyword analysis. 
      This approach represents a major innovation compared to previous published work in 
      the field. METHOD: We first developed an algorithm to automatically learn a variety 
      of expressions that people use to describe their health conditions, thus improving 
      our ability to detect health-related "concepts" expressed in non-medical terms and, 
      in the end, producing a larger body of evidence. We then implemented a Twitter 
      monitoring instrument to finely analyze the presence and combinations of symptoms in 
      tweets. RESULTS: We first evaluate the algorithm's performance on an available 
      dataset of diverse medical condition synonyms, then, we assess its utility in a case 
      study of five common syndromes for surveillance purposes. We show that, by 
      exploiting physicians' knowledge on symptoms positively or negatively related to a 
      given disease, as well as the correspondence between patients' "naïve" terminology 
      and medical jargon, not only can we analyze large volumes of Twitter messages 
      related to that disease, but we can also mine micro-blogs with complex queries, 
      performing fine-grained tweets classification (e.g. those reporting influenza-like 
      illness (ILI) symptoms vs. common cold or allergy). CONCLUSIONS: Our approach yields 
      a very high level of correlation with flu trends derived from traditional 
      surveillance systems. Compared with Google Flu, another popular tool based on query 
      search volumes, our method is more flexible and less sensitive to changes in web 
      search behaviors.

      combatants in real time.
PG  - 7120-41
LID - 10.3390/s140407120 [doi]
AB  - The Spanish Ministry of Defense, through its Future Combatant program, has sought to 
      develop technology aids with the aim of extending combatants' operational 
      capabilities. Within this framework the ATREC project funded by the "Coincidente" 
      program aims at analyzing diverse biometrics to assess by real time monitoring the 
      stress levels of combatants. This project combines multidisciplinary disciplines and 
      fields, including wearable instrumentation, textile technology, signal processing, 
      pattern recognition and psychological analysis of the obtained information. In this 
      work the ATREC project is described, including the different execution phases, the 
      wearable biomedical measurement systems, the experimental setup, the biomedical 
      signal analysis and speech processing performed. The preliminary results obtained 
      from the data analysis collected during the first phase of the project are 
      presented, indicating the good classification performance exhibited when using 
      features obtained from electrocardiographic recordings and electrical bioimpedance 
      measurements from the thorax. These results suggest that cardiac and respiration 
      activity offer better biomarkers for assessment of stress than speech, galvanic skin 
      response or skin temperature when recorded with wearable biomedical measurement 
      systems.

TI  - Significant Change Spotting for Periodic Human Motion Segmentation of Cleaning Tasks 
      Using Wearable Sensors.

AB  - The proportion of the aging population is rapidly increasing around the world, which 
      will cause stress on society and healthcare systems. In recent years, advances in 
      technology have created new opportunities for automatic activities of daily living 
      (ADL) monitoring to improve the quality of life and provide adequate medical service 
      for the elderly. Such automatic ADL monitoring requires reliable ADL information on 
      a fine-grained level, especially for the status of interaction between body gestures 
      and the environment in the real-world. In this work, we propose a significant change 
      spotting mechanism for periodic human motion segmentation during cleaning task 
      performance. A novel approach is proposed based on the search for a significant 
      change of gestures, which can manage critical technical issues in activity 
      recognition, such as continuous data segmentation, individual variance, and category 
      ambiguity. Three typical machine learning classification algorithms are utilized for 
      the identification of the significant change candidate, including a Support Vector 
      Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), and Naive Bayesian (NB) algorithm. 
      Overall, the proposed approach achieves 96.41% in the F1-score by using the SVM 
      classifier. The results show that the proposed approach can fulfill the requirement 
      of fine-grained human motion segmentation for automatic ADL monitoring.

TI  - Protecting the confidentiality and security of personal health information in low- 
      and middle-income countries in the era of SDGs and Big Data.

AB  - BACKGROUND: As increasing amounts of personal information are being collected 
      through a plethora of electronic modalities by statutory and non-statutory 
      organizations, ensuring the confidentiality and security of such information has 
      become a major issue globally. While the use of many of these media can be 
      beneficial to individuals or populations, they can also be open to abuse by 
      individuals or statutory and non-statutory organizations. Recent examples include 
      collection of personal information by national security systems and the development 
      of national programs like the Chinese Social Credit System. In many low- and 
      middle-income countries, an increasing amount of personal health information is 
      being collected. The collection of personal health information is necessary, in 
      order to develop longitudinal medical records and to monitor and evaluate the use, 
      cost, outcome, and impact of health services at facility, sub-national, and national 
      levels. However, if personal health information is not held confidentially and 
      securely, individuals with communicable or non-communicable diseases (NCDs) may be 
      reluctant to use preventive or therapeutic health services, due to fear of being 
      stigmatized or discriminated against. While policymakers and other stakeholders in 
      these countries recognize the need to develop and implement policies for protecting 
      the privacy, confidentiality and security of personal health information, to date 
      few of these countries have developed, let alone implemented, coherent policies. The 
      global HIV response continues to emphasize the importance of collecting HIV-health 
      information, recently re-iterated by the Fast Track to End AIDS by 2030 program and 
      the recent changes in the Guidelines on When to Start Antiretroviral Therapy and on 
      Pre-exposure Prophylaxis for HIV. The success of developing HIV treatment cascades 
      in low- and middle-income countries will require the development of National Health 
      Identification Systems. The success of programs like Universal Health Coverage, 
      under the recently ratified Sustainable Development Goals is also contingent on the 
      availability of personal health information for communicable and non-communicable 
      diseases. DESIGN: Guidance for countries to develop and implement their own 
      guidelines for protecting HIV-information formed the basis of identifying a number 
      of fundamental principles, governing the areas of privacy, confidentiality and 
      security. The use of individual-level data must balance maximizing the benefits from 
      their most effective and fullest use, and minimizing harm resulting from their 
      malicious or inadvertent release. DISCUSSION: These general principles are described 
      in this paper, as along with a bibliography referring to more detailed technical 
      information. A country assessment tool and user's manual, based on these principles, 
      have been developed to support countries to assess the privacy, confidentiality, and 
      security of personal health information at facility, data warehouse/repository, and 
      national levels. The successful development and implementation of national guidance 
      will require strong collaboration at local, regional, and national levels, and this 
      is a pre-condition for the successful implementation of a range of national and 
      global programs. CONCLUSION: This paper is a call for action for stakeholders in 
      low- and middle-income countries to develop and implement such coherent policies and 
      provides fundamental principles governing the areas of privacy, confidentiality, and 
      security of personal health information being collected in low- and middle-income 
      countries.

AB  - Gene expression in Bacillus subtilis from late exponential to stationary phase was 
      monitored by DNA microarrays with samples taken from the culture in LB broth with 
      glucose supplement to prevent sporulation. Three major patterns of gene expression 
      as revealed in this study were consistent to the expression profiling of PerR/Spx 
      regulons and three major sigma factors-SigA, SigB, and SigW. Expression of most 
      SigA-dependent house-keeping genes was significantly decreased and remained at low 
      levels in the stationary phase. The sigB gene and additional genes of the SigB 
      regulon for stress response exhibited a distinct pattern of transient induction with 
      a peak in transition phase. The majority of induced genes after cessation of 
      SigB-dependent surge were subjected to regulation by SigW, PerR, and Spx in response 
      to oxidative stress. No induction of spo0A and skfA regulons supports the 
      suppression of sporulation and cannibalism processes in the stationary phase by 
      glucose supplement. In summary, these results depicted complicated strategies by 
      cells to adapt changes from the fast growing exponential phase toward the stationary 
      phase. The absence of programmed cell death and sporulation greatly facilitated data 
      analysis and the identification of distinct expression patterns in the stationary 
      phase of growth in B. subtilis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Rete middle cerebral artery (MCA) is extremely rare and has not been 
      frequently discussed. Rete MCA is a weblike anomaly of the MCA that does not 
      coalesce and forms a prominent, large single branch from the plexiform vessels in 
      the fetal stage. The purpose of this study was to further elucidate the clinical and 
      radiological characteristics of patients with rete MCA. METHODS: A total of 2262 
      cerebral digital subtraction angiography procedures were performed on 1937 patients 
      at the authors' institution from February 2013 to May 2017. Data analysis included 
      age, sex, clinical symptoms, underlying diseases, coexisting cerebral arterial 
      anomalies, and operative methods and findings. RESULTS: Rete MCAs were found in 13 
      patients, and the incidence of this anomaly was 0.67% (13 of 1937) in this study. Of 
      the 13 patients, 3 had hemorrhagic strokes, 6 had ischemic strokes, and 4 had no 
      symptoms. Eight patients underwent conservative treatment, and 5 patients underwent 
      surgical treatment. Rete MCA is considered a congenital disease of the cerebral 
      vasculature with the possibility of an acquired abnormality, such as an aneurysm, 
      caused by hemodynamic stress. Although an epidemiological survey of rete MCA was not 
      conducted, it is assumed that rete MCA has a high prevalence in Asia. Ischemic and 
      hemorrhagic stroke events are fairly common in rete MCA. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians 
      should understand the radiological and clinical features of patients with rete MCA 
      to avoid misdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment. This anomaly should be 
      differentiated from other vascular diseases and patients presenting incidentally 
      should be carefully monitored because of their vulnerability to both hemorrhagic and 
      ischemic strokes.

PG  - 143-64
LID - 10.1007/978-1-62703-607-8_10 [doi]
AB  - Alternative splicing (AS) is an important mechanism implicated in eukaryotic gene 
      expression, whereby exon segments of precursor-mRNA transcripts are joined together 
      in different arrangements corresponding to diverse isoforms of mature mRNA. 
      Accumulating evidence suggests that in many instances this process is specifically 
      regulated and contributes to the structural and functional diversification of 
      tissues and cell types. Furthermore, several studies support the view that 
      environmental stresses dramatically impact on AS and reported the presence of novel 
      transcript isoforms in response to biotic or abiotic stresses. Since specific 
      regulation of AS in plants is a largely unexplored field of research, large-scale 
      approaches aimed at monitoring AS on a genome-wide level are of increasing 
      importance to gain insights into tissue-specific splicing regulation and to study 
      the effects of changed environmental conditions on pre-mRNA splicing.Here, we 
      describe the concepts of a traditional statistical approach, and a more recently 
      developed machine learning-based method for AS detection from tiling arrays. The 
      here presented approaches were employed for the detection and profiling of AS events 
      in the model plant A. thaliana, and applied to a large dataset comprising 
      transcriptomic expression data from 11 tissues and 13 stress conditions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Continuous glucose monitoring, either real-time (personal) or 
      retrospective (professional mode), can identify day-to-day glucose profiles to guide 
      management decisions for people with type 2 diabetes. We aimed to examine the 
      effects of professional-mode flash glucose monitoring, done at 3-month intervals, in 
      adults with type 2 diabetes in general practice. METHODS: We did a pragmatic, 
      two-arm, open label, 12-month, individually randomised controlled trial (GP-OSMOTIC) 
      in 25 general practices in Victoria, Australia. Eligible participants were adults 
      aged 18-80 years, with type 2 diabetes diagnosed for at least 1 year and HbA(1c) at 
      least 5·5 mmol/mol (0·5%) above their target in the past month despite being 
      prescribed at least two non-insulin glucose-lowering drugs, insulin, or both (with 
      therapy stable for at least 4 months). We randomly assigned participants (1:1) to 
      either use of a professional-mode flash glucose monitoring system or usual clinical 
      care (control). All participants wore the flash glucose monitoring sensor at 
      baseline, and electronic randomisation (using permuted block sizes of four and six, 
      and stratified by clinic) was done after the sensor was attached. Masking of 
      participants and treating clinicians to group allocation was not possible, but the 
      study statistician was masked to allocation when analysing the data. At baseline, 
      and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, participants in the flash glucose monitoring group wore 
      the professional-mode flash glucose monitoring sensor for 5-14 days before their 
      general practice visit. The sensor recorded interstitial glucose concentrations 
      every 15 min, but the glucose data were not available to the participant until their 
      general practice visit, where the sensor output would be uploaded to a computer by 
      the health professional and discussed. Control group participants wore the sensor at 
      baseline and at 12 months for data analysis only, and had usual care visits every 3 
      months. The primary outcome was the between-group difference in mean HbA(1c) at 12 
      months. Secondary outcomes were the between-group differences in: mean percentage 
      time in target glucose range (4-10 mmol/L), based on ambulatory glucose profile data 
      at 12 months; mean diabetes-specific distress (assessed with the Problem Areas In 
      Diabetes [PAID] scale) at 12 months; and mean HbA(1c) at 6 months. Analysis was done 
      by intention to treat. This trial is registered at the Australian and New Zealand 
      Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN12616001372471. FINDINGS: Between Oct 4, 2016, and 
      Nov 17, 2017, we randomly assigned 299 adults: 149 to flash glucose monitoring and 
      150 to usual care. At 6 months, HbA(1c) was lower in the flash glucose monitoring 
      group than in the usual care group (difference -0·5%, 95% CI -0·8% to -0·3%; 
      p=0·0001). However, at 12 months (primary outcome), there was no significant 
      between-group difference in estimated mean HbA(1c) (8·2% [95% CI 8·0 to 8·4] for 
      flash glucose monitoring vs 8·5% [8·3 to 8·7] for usual care; between-group 
      difference -0·3%, 95% CI -0·5 to 0·01; [66 mmol/mol, 95% CI 64 to 68 vs 69 mmol/mol, 
      67 to 72; between-group difference -3·0, 95% CI -5·0 to 0·1]; p=0·059). Mean 
      percentage time spent in target glucose range at 12 months was 7·9% (95% CI 2·3 to 
      13·5) higher in the flash glucose monitoring group than in the usual care group 
      (p=0·0060). Diabetes-specific distress PAID scores were unchanged at 12 months 
      (between-group difference -0·7, 95% CI -3·3 to 1·9; p=0·61). No episodes of severe 
      hypoglycaemia or treatment-related deaths were reported. One participant died during 
      the study from causes unrelated to the intervention (following complications 
      post-myocardial infarction with multiple comorbidities). INTERPRETATION: 
      Professional-mode flash glucose monitoring in adults with type 2 diabetes in general 
      practice did not improve the primary outcome of HbA(1c) at 12 months or 
      diabetes-specific distress compared with usual care, but did improve time in target 
      glucose range at 12 months and HbA(1c) at 6 months. Our findings suggest that 
      professional-mode flash glucose monitoring can be implemented in a pragmatic primary 
      care environment. Although there was no change in HbA(1c) at 12 months, the improved 
      time in target range might reflect the potential of the technology to support 
      personalised clinical care by providing insights into glycaemic profiles for some 
      people with type 2 diabetes. FUNDING: National Health and Medical Research Council

AB  - BACKGROUND: Electronic Healthcare Records (EHRs) are created to capture summaries of 
      care and contact made to healthcare services. EHRs offer a means to analyse 
      admissions to hospitals for epidemiological research. In the United Kingdom (UK), 
      England, Scotland and Wales maintain separate data stores, which are administered 
      and managed exclusively by devolved Government. This independence results in 
      harmonisation challenges, not least lack of uniformity, making it difficult to 
      evaluate care, diagnoses and treatment across the UK. To overcome this lack of 
      uniformity, it is important to develop methods to integrate EHRs to provide a 
      multi-nation dataset of health. OBJECTIVE: To develop and describe a method which 
      integrates the EHRs of Armed Forces personnel in England, Scotland and Wales based 
      on variable commonality to produce a multi-nation dataset of secondary health care. 
      METHODS: An Armed Forces cohort was used to extract and integrate three EHR 
      datasets, using commonality as the linkage point. This was achieved by evaluating 
      and combining variables which shared the same characteristics. EHRs representing 
      Accident and Emergency (A&E), Admitted Patient Care (APC) and Outpatient care were 
      combined to create a patient-level history spanning three nations. Patient-level 
      EHRs were examined to ascertain admission differences, common diagnoses and record 
      completeness. RESULTS: A total of 6,336 Armed Forces personnel were matched, of 
      which 5,460 personnel had 7,510 A&E visits, 9,316 APC episodes and 45,005 Outpatient 
      appointments. We observed full completeness for diagnoses in APC, whereas Outpatient 
      admissions were sparsely coded; with 88% of diagnoses coded as "Unknown/unspecified 
      cause of morbidity". In addition, A&E records were sporadically coded; we found five 
      coding systems for identifying reason for admission. CONCLUSION: At present, EHRs 
      are designed to monitor the cost of treatment, enable administrative oversight, and 
      are not currently suited to epidemiological research. However, only small changes 
      may be needed to take advantage of what should be a highly cost-effective means of 
      delivering important research for the benefit of the NHS.

TI  - Human Amygdala Tracks a Feature-Based Valence Signal Embedded within the Facial 
      Expression of Surprise.
PG  - 9510-9518
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1375-17.2017 [doi]
AB  - Human amygdala function has been traditionally associated with processing the 
      affective valence (negative vs positive) of an emotionally charged event, especially 
      those that signal fear or threat. However, this account of human amygdala function 
      can be explained by alternative views, which posit that the amygdala might be tuned 
      to either (1) general emotional arousal (activation vs deactivation) or (2) specific 
      emotion categories (fear vs happy). Delineating the pure effects of valence 
      independent of arousal or emotion category is a challenging task, given that these 
      variables naturally covary under many circumstances. To circumvent this issue and 
      test the sensitivity of the human amygdala to valence values specifically, we 
      measured the dimension of valence within the single facial expression category of 
      surprise. Given the inherent valence ambiguity of this category, we show that 
      surprised expression exemplars are attributed valence and arousal values that are 
      uniquely and naturally uncorrelated. We then present fMRI data from both sexes, 
      showing that the amygdala tracks these consensus valence values. Finally, we provide 
      evidence that these valence values are linked to specific visual features of the 
      mouth region, isolating the signal by which the amygdala detects this valence 
      information.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT There is an open question as to whether human 
      amygdala function tracks the valence value of cues in the environment, as opposed to 
      either a more general emotional arousal value or a more specific emotion category 
      distinction. Here, we demonstrate the utility of surprised facial expressions 
      because exemplars within this emotion category take on valence values spanning the 
      dimension of bipolar valence (positive to negative) at a consistent level of 
      emotional arousal. Functional neuroimaging data showed that amygdala responses 
      tracked the valence of surprised facial expressions, unconfounded by arousal. 
      Furthermore, a machine learning classifier identified particular visual features of 
      the mouth region that predicted this valence effect, isolating the specific visual 
      signal that might be driving this neural valence response.

TI  - Assessing the Culture of Residency Using the C - Change Resident Survey: Validity 
      Evidence in 34 U.S. Residency Programs.
PG  - 783-789
LID - 10.1007/s11606-017-4038-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A practical instrument is needed to reliably measure the clinical 
      learning environment and professionalism for residents. OBJECTIVE: To develop and 
      present evidence of validity of an instrument to assess the culture of residency 
      programs and the clinical learning environment. DESIGN: During 2014-2015, we 
      surveyed residents using the C - Change Resident Survey to assess residents' 
      perceptions of the culture in their programs. PARTICIPANTS: Residents in all years 
      of training in 34 programs in internal medicine, pediatrics, and general surgery in 
      14 geographically diverse public and private academic health systems. MAIN MEASURES: 
      The C - Change Resident Survey assessed residents' perceptions of 13 dimensions of 
      the culture: Vitality, Self-Efficacy, Institutional Support, 
      Relationships/Inclusion, Values Alignment, Ethical/Moral Distress, Respect, 
      Mentoring, Work-Life Integration, Gender Equity, Racial/Ethnic Minority Equity, and 
      self-assessed Competencies. We measured the internal reliability of each of the 13 
      dimensions and evaluated response process, content validity, and construct-related 
      evidence validity by assessing relationships predicted by our conceptual model and 
      prior research. We also assessed whether the measurements were sensitive to 
      differences in specialty and across institutions. KEY RESULTS: A total of 1708 
      residents completed the survey [internal medicine: n = 956, pediatrics: n = 411, 
      general surgery: n = 311 (51% women; 16% underrepresented in medicine minority)], 
      with a response rate of 70% (range across programs, 51-87%). Internal consistency of 
      each dimension was high (Cronbach α: 0.73-0.90). The instrument was able to detect 
      significant differences in the learning environment across programs and sites. 
      Evidence of validity was supported by a good response process and the demonstration 
      of several relationships predicted by our conceptual model. CONCLUSIONS: The C - 
      Change Resident Survey assesses the clinical learning environment for residents, and 
      we encourage further study of validity in different contexts. Results could be used 
      to facilitate and monitor improvements in the clinical learning environment and 
      resident well-being.

      for administering the survey and analyzing data, and that any investigator could be 
      paid from these funds, may seem to qualify in the strictest sense as a potential 
      conflict of interest in a paper reporting on the survey’s validity. In this regard, 
      the National Initiative on Gender, Culture and Leadership in Medicine, C - Change, 
      is entirely externally funded. All grants and contracts from various institutions 
      requesting our survey administration and “blind” data analysis of collected data are 
      awarded to Brandeis University, which pays some salary support to some of the 
      investigators (LP, JC, RB, SS). In this study, all survey work was paid for by a 
      grant from the Arnold P. Gold Foundation and supplemental funders. C - Change 
      maintains rigorous scientific standards for conducting its studies, and there is 
      complete separation of income flowing into the University for the overall Center 
      support and the survey administration and analysis. IRB approval was obtained from 
      Brandeis University.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Pain management is an important aspect of burn management. We 
      developed a routine pain monitoring system and pain management protocol for burn 
      patients. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of our new pain 
      management system. METHODS: From May 2011 to November 2011, the prospective study 
      was performed with 107 burn patients. We performed control group (n=58) data 
      analysis and then developed the pain management protocol and monitoring system. 
      Next, we applied our protocol to patients and performed protocol group (n=49) data 
      analysis, and compared this to control group data. Data analysis was performed using 
      the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) of background pain and procedural pain, 
      Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), 
      State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Scale (STAIS), and Holmes and Rahe Stress Scale 
      (HRSS). RESULTS: The NRS of background pain for the protocol group was significantly 
      decreased compared to the control group (2.8±2.0 versus 3.9±1.9), and the NRS of 
      procedural pain of the protocol group was significantly decreased compared to the 
      control group (4.8±2.8 versus 3.7±2.5). CAPS and HDRS were decreased in the protocol 
      group, but did not have statistical significance. STAIS and HRSS were decreased in 
      the protocol group, but only the STAIS had statistical significance. CONCLUSION: Our 
      new pain management system was effective in burn pain management. However, adequate 
      pain management can only be accomplished by a continuous and thorough effort. 
      Therefore, pain control protocol and pain monitoring systems need to be under 
      constant revision and improvement using creative ideas and approaches.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Previous studies have demonstrated that the time rate of blood pressure 
      (BP) variation was associated with early carotid atherosclerosis, independent of 
      peripheral and central BP levels. We evaluated the association between the rate of 
      BP variation, derived from ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) data analysis, and the 
      severity and topography of coronary artery lesion in a cohort of normotensive 
      patients with suspected coronary artery disease. METHODS: ABPM and coronary 
      angiography were performed in 162 normotensive patients with suspected coronary 
      artery disease. The topography and severity of coronary artery lesions were assessed 
      by Gensini score. The time rate of BP variation was defined as the first derivative 
      of the BP values against time. RESULTS: Patients with coronary artery disease (n = 
      123) presented significantly (P = 0.005) higher daytime rate of systolic BP 
      variation than control patients (n = 39). Multiple linear regression models revealed 
      independent determinants of Gensini score in the following rank order: diabetes 
      mellitus (β: +0.286, P < 0.001), daytime rate of systolic BP variation (β: +0.277, P 
      < 0.001), daytime systolic BP (β: +0.216, P = 0.002), smoking (β: +0.178, P = 0.008) 
      and hypercholesterolemia (β: +0.158, P = 0.020). A 0.1 mmHg/min increase in the 
      daytime rate of systolic BP variation correlated with an increment of 4.935 in the 
      Gensini score (95% CI 2.432-7.438). CONCLUSION: Steeper BP variations may produce a 
      greater stress on the arterial wall and may have an additive role to vascular risk 
      factors and BP parameters in the detection of the severity of coronary artery 
      lesions in normotensive individuals with suspected coronary artery disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pregnancy testing in cattle is commonly invasive requiring manual rectal 
      palpation of the reproductive tract that presents risks to the operator and 
      pregnancy. Alternative non-invasive tests have been developed but have not gained 
      popularity due to poor specificity, sensitivity and the inconvenience of sample 
      handling. Our aim is to present the pilot study and proof of concept of a new non 
      invasive technique to sense the presence and age (limited to the closest trimester 
      of pregnancy) of the foetus by recording the electrical and audio signals produced 
      by the foetus heartbeat using an array of specialized sensors embedded in a stand 
      alone handheld prototype device. The device was applied to the right flank 
      (approximately at the intercept of a horizontal line drawn through the right mid 
      femur region of the cow and a vertical line drawn anywhere between lumbar vertebrae 
      3 to 5) of more than 2000 cattle from 13 different farms, including pregnant and not 
      pregnant, a diversity of breeds, and both dairy and beef herds. Pregnancy status 
      response is given "on the spot" from an optimized machine learning algorithm running 
      on the device within seconds after data collection. RESULTS: Using combined 
      electrical and audio foetal signals we detected pregnancy with a sensitivity of 
      87.6% and a specificity of 74.6% for all recorded data. Those values increase to 91% 
      and 81% respectively by removing files with excessive noise (19%).Foetus ageing was 
      achieved by comparing the detected foetus heart-rate with published tables. However, 
      given the challenging farm environment of a restless cow, correct foetus ageing was 
      achieved for only 21% of the correctly diagnosed pregnant cows. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      conclusion we have found that combining ECG and PCG measurements on the right flank 
      of cattle provides a reliable and rapid method of pregnancy testing. The device has 
      potential to be applied by unskilled operators. This will generate more efficient 
      and productive management of farms. There is potential for the device to be applied 
      to large endangered quadrupeds in captive breeding programs where early, safe and 
      reliable pregnancy diagnosis can be imperative but currently difficult to achieve.

AB  - Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is not only a widely used species in the Fish Embryo 
      Toxicity (FET) test but also an emerging model in behavioural ecotoxicology. By 
      using automatic behaviour tracking technology, locomotion of developing zebrafish 
      (ZF) larvae can be accurately recorded and potentially used in an ecotoxicological 
      context to detect toxicant-induced behavioural alterations. In this study, we 
      explored if and how quantitative locomotion data can be used for sub-lethal toxicity 
      testing within the FET framework. We exposed ZF embryos to silver ions and 
      nanoparticles, which previously have been reported to cause neurodevelopmental 
      toxicity and behavioural retardation in early-life stages of ZF. Exposure to a broad 
      range of silver (Ag(+) and AgNPs) concentrations was conducted, and developmental 
      toxicity was assessed using FET criteria. For behavioural toxicity assessment, 
      locomotion of exposed ZF eleutheroembryos (120hpf) was quantified according to a 
      customised behavioural assay in an automatic video tracking system. A set of 
      repeated episodes of dark/light stimulation were used to artificially stress ZF and 
      evoke photo-motor responses, which were consequently utilized for locomotion 
      profiling. Our locomotion-based behaviour profiling approach consisted of (1) 
      dose-response ranking for multiple and single locomotion variables; (2) quantitative 
      assessment of locomotion structure; and (3) analysis of ZF responsiveness to 
      darkness stimulation. We documented that both silver forms caused adverse effects on 
      development and inhibited hatchability and, most importantly, altered locomotion. 
      High Ag(+) and AgNPs exposures significantly suppressed locomotion and a clear shift 
      in locomotion towards inactivity was reported. Additionally, we noted that low, 
      environmentally relevant Ag(+) concentrations may cause subordinate locomotive 
      changes (hyperactivity) in developing fish. Overall, it was concluded that our 
      locomotion-based behaviour-testing scheme can be used jointly with FET and can 
      provide endpoints for sub-lethal toxicity. When combined with multivariate data 
      analysis, this approach facilitated new insights for handling and analysis of data 
      generated by automatized behavioural tracking systems.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Primary Objective: To determine the feasibility of delivering a 
      protocolised, remote, online, Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing (EMDR) 
      intervention, within 12-weeks of hospital discharge, for adult survivors of Covid-19 
      related critical illness. Secondary objectives: To investigate whether remotely 
      delivered EMDR can improve psychological outcome following Covid-19 related critical 
      illness, specifically Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), anxiety and depression. 
      TRIAL DESIGN: This is a single centre, randomised controlled cohort feasibility 
      trial. PARTICIPANTS: Participants will be recruited following discharge from the 
      Intensive Care Unit at University Hospital Southampton, United Kingdom. Eligible 
      patients will have received mechanical ventilation for a minimum of 24 hours, tested 
      Covid-19 positive by polymerase chain reaction, will be over the age of 18 years and 
      have the capacity to provide informed consent. Patients will be excluded if they 
      have pre-existing cognitive impairment, pre-existing psychotic diagnosis or are not 
      expected to survive post-hospital discharge. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Group one: 
      patients in the control arm will receive their standard package of prescribed care, 
      following discharge home from hospital. If they experience any adverse physical or 
      psychological health-conditions, they will access care through the usual available 
      channels. Group two: patients randomly allocated to the intervention arm will 
      receive their standard package of prescribed care, following discharge home from 
      hospital. In addition, they will be referred to the Intensive Psychological 
      Therapies Service in Poole, United Kingdom. They will receive an online appointment 
      within 12-weeks of discharge home from hospital. They will receive a maximum of 
      eight, weekly sessions of EMDR, delivered by a trained psychological therapist, 
      following the Recent Traumatic Episode Protocol (R-TEP). Appendices 1 and 2 of the 
      attached trial protocol contain a detailed description of the R-TEP intervention, 
      written in accordance with the Template for Intervention Description and Replication 
      (TIDieR) checklist and guide. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome from this trial 
      will be feasibility. Feasibility will be determined by recruitment rates, expressed 
      as a percentage of eligible patients approached, completion of the EMDR 
      intervention, completion of final assessment at 6-months, incidence of attributable 
      adverse events and protocol adherence by the psychological therapists. Secondary, 
      exploratory outcomes will be assessed by comparison between the control and 
      intervention groups at 6-months post-hospital discharge. Psychometric evaluation 
      will consist of the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version and Hospital Anxiety and 
      Depression Scale. In addition, we will assess health-related quality of life using 
      the EQ5D-5L, physical activity using wrist worn activity monitors and nutritional 
      state using the Council of Nutrition Appetite Questionnaire. RANDOMISATION: 
      Consenting participants will be randomly allocated to intervention or usual care 
      using an internet-based system (ALEA(TM)). Participants will be randomly assigned, 
      on a 1:1 ratio, to receive either standard care (control) or the standard care plus 
      online EMDR R-TEP (Intervention) BLINDING (MASKING): Due to the nature of the 
      intervention, participants cannot be blinded to group allocation. 6-month patient 
      reported outcome measures will be completed using an online, electronic case report 
      form. Group allocation will be masked during data analysis. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED 
      (SAMPLE SIZE): This is a feasibility study, the results of which will be used to 
      power a definitive study if appropriate. We anticipate a 25% mortality /loss to 
      follow-up. A total of 26 patients will be recruited to this study, 13 patients in 
      each arm. TRIAL STATUS: CovEMERALD opened to recruitment on 23(rd) September 2020 
      with an anticipated recruitment period of 6-months. We are using protocol version 
      number 1.2 (1(st) June 2020) TRIAL REGISTRATION: CovEMERALD was registered on 
      clinicaltrials.gov NCT04455360 on 2(nd) July 2020 FULL PROTOCOL: The full protocol

TI  - Attitudes and barriers towards HIV screening: A qualitative study of people living 
      with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in Malaysia.
PG  - 242-247
LID - 10.1177/1757177416689723 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Understanding patients' perspective towards HIV screening in Malaysia is 
      pivotal to explore challenges faced by these individuals. This would be beneficial 
      for developing local plans to improve the health-seeking behaviours among population 
      at risk of HIV/AIDS. METHODS: A qualitative research methodology was adopted to 
      explore HIV/AIDS patients' views about disease screening. A semi-structured 
      interview guide was used for in-depth patient interviews. All interviews were 
      audio-recorded and were subjected to a standard content analysis framework for data 
      analysis. RESULTS: Most patients were positive about screening and the value of 
      knowing about their status early. However, fear of social stigma, discrimination, 
      lack of support system and lack of public understanding were identified as major 
      concerns affecting their willingness to be screened. They were concerned about 
      mandatory screening being implemented without improvement in support system and 
      public education. CONCLUSIONS: Reluctance to seek HIV screening is an important 
      factor contributing to transmission in developing countries. In the Malaysian 
      context, efforts should be made to strengthen screening strategies especially in the 
      most-at-risk populations to monitor the epidemic and target prevention strategies. 
      PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: In a multicultural context, HIV preventive strategies must 
      include disease awareness, including measure to tackle barriers towards screening.

AB  - Stress hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia are associated with increased morbidity and 
      mortality in the critically ill. Intermittent, random blood glucose (BG) 
      measurements can miss episodes of hyper- and hypoglycemia. The purpose of this study 
      was to determine the accuracy of the Symphony® continuous glucose monitor (CGM) in 
      critically ill cardiac surgery patients. Fifteen adult cardiac surgery patients were 
      evaluated immediately postoperatively in the intensive care unit. Prelude® SkinPrep 
      prepared the skin and a sensor was applied to 2 test sites on each subject to 
      monitor interstitial fluid glucose. Reference BG was sampled at 30- to 60-minute 
      intervals. The skin at the test sites was inspected for adverse effects. Accuracy of 
      the retrospectively analyzed CGM data relative to reference BG values was determined 
      using continuous glucose-error grid analysis (CG-EGA) and mean absolute relative 
      difference (MARD). Using 570 Symphony CGM glucose readings paired with reference BG 
      measurements, CG-EGA showed that 99.6% of the readings were within zones A and B. BG 
      measurements ranged from 73 to 251 mg/dL. The MARD was 12.3%. No adverse device 
      effects were reported. The Symphony CGM system is able to safely, continuously, and 
      noninvasively monitor glucose in the transdermal interstitial fluid of cardiac 
      surgery intensive care unit patients with accuracy similar to that reported with 
      other CGM systems. Future versions of the system will need real-time data analysis, 
      fast warm-up, and less frequent calibrations to be used in the clinical setting.

TI  - Validity assessment of the symptom checklist SCL-90-R and shortened versions for the

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R) is a widely used symptomatic 
      distress questionnaire. A translated version of the SCL-90-R has been applied in 
      Ukrainian general population surveys several times but has not yet been validated in 
      this country. The SCL-90-R and its short versions (BSI-53, SCL-27, BSI-18, SCL-14 
      and SCL-9-K) were investigated in order to comparatively assess their properties and 
      applications in Ukraine. METHODS: Secondary analysis of three nationally 
      representative cross-sectional surveys (1997, 1999 and 2014) using SCL-90-R was 
      applied. Two thousand sixty nine respondents participated in 2014; the sample size 
      for the 1997 and 1999 surveys was 1810 respondents per wave. Statistical data 
      analysis is based on calculating internal consistencies with Cronbach's Alpha, 
      confirmatory factor analysis, nonparametric correlations and effect sizes for the 
      equivalence of the full and short versions. RESULTS: The scales of SCL-90-R and its 
      shortened versions showed equally high internal consistencies. With regard to 
      factorial validity, 2014 data confirmed the dimensional structure of all versions. 
      Unsatisfactory results were found in 1997 and 1999 for SCL-90-R and in 1997 for 
      SCL-27, based on the Chi-square criterion (χ2/degrees of freedom > 5), though other 
      indexes suggested satisfactory model fit (RMSEA < 0.06; CFI, TLI > 0.95). Analysis 
      of the equivalence of shortened and full versions of the SCL-90-R has shown the 
      presence of small effect sizes. CONCLUSION: BSI-18 and SCL-9-K are recommended for 
      use in general population surveys as more economical versions of SCL-90-R. Both 
      versions revealed satisfactory validity in 1997, 1999 and 2014.

LID - 10.1080/10408398.2020.1863328 [doi]
AB  - By 2050, the global population is projected to be in excess of nine billion people. 
      This will result in an increased burden and stress on the food production systems, 
      particularly in adjustments to several stages of the value chain that will require 
      improvements and/or modifications in their effectiveness such as reducing waste, 
      adapting to climate change, food security, and health. Disruptions such as digital 
      agriculture, digital food, food agility, big data, have been utilized to 
      characterize the changes in the way agro-food systems evolve and function, as well 
      as in the approach they have been analyzed, measured, and monitored. It has been 
      long recognized that the food industry is considered as a data driven enterprise. 
      These characteristics are very important as the food industry becomes global and 
      sustainable. The food industry is currently undergoing significant changes, and with 
      this, challenges are occurring. These challenges are brought about from the food 
      chains, climate changes, and the ability to be resilient in the production of food. 
      Furthermore, health and cultural changes to food are occurring, where the diseases 
      of obesity, diabetes, and aging in the population will continue to change the 
      consumer's patterns and choices; whereby the consumer will be persuaded to choose 
      and eat healthy and more nutritious foods. Indeed, the cultural awareness and social 
      innovation to prevent food waste and therefore improve food security and 
      sustainability will also prove to further complexities. This short review will 
      briefly discuss some of the forefront issues in food value chains with a focus on 
      using technology.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, has developed special mechanisms 
      to regulate its osmotic balance to adapt to fluctuations of salinities in coastal 
      zones. To understand the oyster's euryhaline adaptation, we analyzed salt stress 
      effectors metabolism pathways under different salinities (salt 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 
      and 40 for 7 days) using transcriptome data, physiology experiment and quantitative 
      real-time PCR. RESULTS: Transcriptome data uncovered 189, 480, 207 and 80 marker 
      genes for monitoring physiology status of oysters and the environment conditions. 
      Three known salt stress effectors (involving ion channels, aquaporins and free amino 
      acids) were examined. The analysis of ion channels and aquaporins indicated that 7 
      days long-term salt stress inhibited voltage-gated Na(+)/K(+) channel and aquaporin 
      but increased calcium-activated K(+) channel and Ca(2+) channel. As the most 
      important category of osmotic stress effector, we analyzed the oyster FAAs 
      metabolism pathways (including taurine, glycine, alanine, beta-alanine, proline and 
      arginine) and explained FAAs functional mechanism for oyster low salinity 
      adaptation. FAAs metabolism key enzyme genes displayed expression differentiation in 
      low salinity adapted individuals comparing with control which further indicated that 
      FAAs played important roles for oyster salinity adaptation. A global metabolic 
      pathway analysis (iPath) of oyster expanded genes displayed a co-expansion of FAAs 
      metabolism in C. gigas compared with seven other species, suggesting oyster's 
      powerful ability regarding FAAs metabolism, allowing it to adapt to fluctuating 
      salinities, which may be one important mechanism underlying euryhaline adaption in 
      oyster. Additionally, using transcriptome data analysis, we uncovered salt stress 
      transduction networks in C. gigas. CONCLUSIONS: Our results represented oyster salt 
      stress effectors functional mechanisms under salt stress conditions and explained 
      the expansion of FAAs metabolism pathways as the most important effectors for oyster 
      euryhaline adaptation. This study was the first to explain oyster euryhaline 
      adaptation at a genome-wide scale in C. gigas.

AB  - In addition to classic motor signs and symptoms, individuals with Parkinson's 
      disease (PD) are characterized by emotional deficits. Ongoing brain activity can be 
      recorded by electroencephalograph (EEG) to discover the links between emotional 
      states and brain activity. This study utilized machine-learning algorithms to 
      categorize emotional states in PD patients compared with healthy controls (HC) using 
      EEG. Twenty non-demented PD patients and 20 healthy age-, gender-, and education 
      level-matched controls viewed happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise, and disgust 
      emotional stimuli while fourteen-channel EEG was being recorded. Multimodal stimulus 
      (combination of audio and visual) was used to evoke the emotions. To classify the 
      EEG-based emotional states and visualize the changes of emotional states over time, 
      this paper compares four kinds of EEG features for emotional state classification 
      and proposes an approach to track the trajectory of emotion changes with manifold 
      learning. From the experimental results using our EEG data set, we found that (a) 
      bispectrum feature is superior to other three kinds of features, namely power 
      spectrum, wavelet packet and nonlinear dynamical analysis; (b) higher frequency 
      bands (alpha, beta and gamma) play a more important role in emotion activities than 
      lower frequency bands (delta and theta) in both groups and; (c) the trajectory of 
      emotion changes can be visualized by reducing subject-independent features with 
      manifold learning. This provides a promising way of implementing visualization of 
      patient's emotional state in real time and leads to a practical system for 
      noninvasive assessment of the emotional impairments associated with neurological 
      disorders.

TI  - Individuals with insomnia misrecognize angry faces as fearful faces while missing 
      the eyes: an eye-tracking study.
LID - 10.1093/sleep/zsy220 [doi]
AB  - Individuals with insomnia have been found to have disturbed perception of facial 
      expressions. Through eye movement examinations, here we test the hypothesis that 
      this effect is due to impaired visual attention functions for retrieving diagnostic 
      features in facial expression judgments. Twenty-three individuals with insomnia 
      symptoms and 23 controls without insomnia completed a task to categorize happy, sad, 
      fearful, and angry facial expressions. The participants with insomnia were less 
      accurate in recognizing angry faces and misidentified them as fearful faces more 
      often than the controls. A hidden Markov modeling approach for eye movement data 
      analysis revealed that when viewing facial expressions, more individuals with 
      insomnia adopted a nose-mouth eye movement pattern focusing on the vertical face 
      midline while more controls adopted an eyes-mouth pattern preferentially attending 
      to lateral features, particularly the two eyes. As previous studies found that the 
      primary diagnostic feature for recognizing angry faces is the eyes while the 
      diagnostic features for other facial expressions involve the mouth region, missing 
      the eye region may contribute to specific difficulties in recognizing angry facial 
      expressions, consistent with our behavioral finding in participants with insomnia 
      symptoms. Taken together, the findings suggest that impaired information selection 
      through visual attention control may be related to the compromised emotion 
      perception in individuals with insomnia.

TI  - Physical Activity and Psychological Stress Detection and Assessment of Their Effects 
      on Glucose Concentration Predictions in Diabetes Management.
LID - 10.1109/TBME.2020.3049109 [doi]
AB  - Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) enables improvements in diabetes treatment by 
      providing frequent temporal information on glycemia, and prediction of future 
      glucose concentration (GC) trends. The accurate prediction of the future GC 
      trajectory is important for making meal, activity and insulin dosing decisions. 
      Glucose concentration values are affected by various physiological and metabolic 
      variations, such as physical activity (PA) and acute psychological stress (APS), in 
      addition to meals and insulin. In this work, we extend our adaptive glucose modeling 
      framework to incorporate the effects of PA and APS on the GC predictions by 
      integrating input features derived from supplemental physiological variables 
      measured from a wearable device. We use a wristband that is conducive of use by 
      free-living ambulatory people. The readily obtained biosignals are used to generate 
      new quantifiable input features for PA and APS. Machine learning techniques are used 
      to estimate the type and intensity of the PA and APS when they occur individually 
      and concurrently. Variables quantifying the characteristics of both PA and APS are 
      integrated for the first time as exogenous inputs in an adaptive system 
      identification technique for enhancing the accuracy of GC predictions. Data from 
      clinical experiments are used to illustrate the improvement in GC prediction 
      accuracy. The average mean absolute error (MAE) of one-hour-ahead GC predictions 
      decreases from 35.1 to 31.9 mg/dL (p-value=0.01) for testing data with the inclusion 
      of PA information. The average MAE of one-hour-ahead GC predictions decreases from 
      16.9 to 14.2 mg/dL (p-value=0.006) for testing data with the inclusion of PA and APS 
      information.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Although many centers have reported their experience on maternal and 
      perinatal outcomes in renal transplant recipients. Very few information can be found 
      about the psychological aspects that may rise for these patients during pregnancy. 
      Considering the importance of the psychological concerns for this kind of patients, 
      we have developed a protocol to better assist renal transplant recipients during 
      pregnancy and here we show what we have learnt. OBJECTIVES: To understand how the 
      maternal concerns are seen from renal transplant recipients in terms of 
      psychological aspects. METHODS: Fifteen pregnant kidney transplanted women with an 
      average age of 27.5years were included in the study. All patients have been 
      investigated beyond the 20th week of pregnancy to delivery. The study is 
      cross-sectional, qualitative, and participation is based on developed 
      phenomenological method. Final data analysis will be done through thematic analysis 
      and hermeneutics of meaning. The only exclusion criteria were the current presence 
      of psychiatric disorders or use of drugs that could influence cognitive and 
      emotional aspects during the psychological evaluation. RESULTS: During the last two 
      years we have observed in these women that all of them are aware of the risks of 
      pregnancy after transplantation. Qualitative aspects were: Pregnant with kidney 
      transplantation show: in relation to pregnancy, the desire to be mothers, to give a 
      son to her husband, to become a healthy person again; they believe that conception 
      is God's will, they have fear of pregnancy, ambivalence of feelings (fear and 
      happiness). In relation to the graft, they reported fear of baby malformations, fear 
      and anguish of graft loss, still consider it worth the risk of having the baby, and 
      some women name the graft, if it were another infant. In relation to delivery, state 
      anxiety and anguish at the proximity of labor (fear of labor pain, anesthesia, 
      cesarean section, vaginal delivery and the "psychic pain"). CONCLUSION: Pending the 
      final results of this study, we still observed that these patients and their 
      husbands require multidisciplinary monitoring since the beginning of pregnancy. 
      Factors religious, cultural and psychic are involved in the desire to be mothers.

TI  - Implementing an institution-wide quality improvement policy to ensure appropriate 
      use of continuous cardiac monitoring: a mixed-methods retrospective data analysis 
      and direct observation study.
PG  - 796-802
LID - 10.1136/bmjqs-2015-004137 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hospitals have been slow to adopt guidelines from the American Heart 
      Association (AHA) limiting the use of continuous cardiac monitoring for fear of 
      missing important patient cardiac events. A new continuous cardiac monitoring policy 
      was implemented at a tertiary-care hospital seeking to monitor only those patients 
      who were clinically indicated and decrease the number of false alarms in order to 
      improve overall alarm response. METHODS: Leadership support was secured, a 
      cross-functional alarm management task force was created, and a system-wide policy 
      was developed based on current AHA guidelines. Process measures, including cardiac 
      monitoring rate, monitored transport rate, emergency department (ED) boarding rate 
      and the percentage of false, unnecessary and true alarms, were measured to determine 
      the policy's impact on patient care. Outcome measures, including length of stay and 
      mortality rate, were measured to determine the impact on patient outcomes. RESULTS: 
      Cardiac monitoring rate decreased 53.2% (0.535 to 0.251 per patient day, p<0.001), 
      monitored transport rate decreased 15.5% (0.216 to 0.182 per patient day, p<0.001), 
      ED patient boarding rate decreased 36.6% (5.5% to 3.5% of ED patients, p<0.001) and 
      the percentage of false alarms decreased (18.8% to 9.6%, p<0.001). Neither the 
      length of stay nor mortality changed significantly after the policy was implemented. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The observed improvements in process measures coupled with no adverse 
      effects to patient outcomes suggest that the overall system became more resilient to 
      current and emerging demands. This study indicates that when collaboration across a 
      diverse team is coupled with strong leadership support, policies and procedures such 
      as this one can improve clinical practice and patient care.

TI  - Working with a domestic assessment system to estimate the need of support and care 
      of elderly and disabled persons: results from field studies.
PG  - 210-31
LID - 10.3109/17538157.2014.931857 [doi]
AB  - This article describes the results of field studies performed over a period between 
      five months and 24 months. The objectives of these studies were to collect long-term 
      real-life data to evaluate how these data can be mapped to items on standardized 
      assessment tests and which presentation method is most suitable to inform caregivers 
      about critical situations and changes in health or care needs. A Home-monitoring 
      system which uses modern sensor technologies was developed for and used in these 
      field studies. It was installed in living environments of seven people (three who 
      were not in need of care, two in need of care, and two with mental disabilities). 
      The data were generated by sensor data acquisition and questionnaire reporting. Four 
      types of data analysis and representation were evaluated to support caregivers. 
      Results show that sensor data can be used to determine information directly or 
      indirectly, which can be mapped to relevant assessment items and presented with 
      different degrees of granularity. It is also feasible to determine and present 
      additional information of potential interest which cannot be directly mapped to any 
      assessment item. Sensor data can also be displayed in a live view. This live data 
      representation led to a decrease in the caregivers' workload when assessed according 
      to the German version of the Perceived Stress Questionnaire.

TI  - Informational coping style and depressive symptoms in family decision makers.
PG  - 410-20
LID - 10.4037/ajcc2010354 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Overwhelmed family decision makers of chronically critically ill 
      patients must comprehend vital information to make complex treatment decisions that 
      are consistent with patients' preferences. Exploration of informational coping 
      styles of family decision makers may yield evidence for tailored communication 
      practices supporting the psychological and informational needs of family decision 
      makers. OBJECTIVES: To describe patterns in the demographic characteristics and 
      informational coping styles of family decision makers; to assess differences in 
      informational satisfaction, role stress, and depressive symptoms between family 
      decision makers classified as monitors and as blunters; and to describe the 
      predictive associations between informational coping styles, informational 
      satisfaction, and role stress on depressive symptoms in family decision makers. 
      METHODS: A secondary data analysis of 210 family decision makers of cognitively 
      impaired patients who required 3 days or more of mechanical ventilation. On 
      enrollment, decision makers completed the abbreviated Miller Behavioral Style Scale 
      to assess informational coping styles, the Critical Care Family Satisfaction 
      Survey's informational subscale to assess informational satisfaction, a single-item 
      measure of role stress, and the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale 
      to assess depressive symptoms. RESULTS: No associations emerged between demographic 
      characteristics and informational coping styles of family decision makers. Monitors 
      had higher depression scores than did blunters. Both information coping style and 
      informational satisfaction influenced depressive symptoms; however, role stress was 
      the most significant predictor. CONCLUSIONS: Family decision makers classified as 
      monitors were at higher risk for depression than were those who seem to avoid 
      information. Targeting monitors with additional psychological and informational 
      support may mitigate their psychological impairment.

TI  - The use of tree barks and human fingernails for monitoring metal levels in urban 
      areas of different population densities of Porto Alegre, Brazil.
PG  - 2433-2441
LID - 10.1007/s11356-016-7832-5 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of tree barks as a bioindicator of 
      atmospheric pollution in areas of contrasting population densities and to associate 
      the levels of elements found in this bioindicator with those obtained in fingernail 
      samples collected from students living in the same study areas. Tree bark samples 
      were collected from urban areas near highways in regions with high (Area A), 
      intermediate (Area B), and low (Area C) population densities of Porto Alegre, 
      Brazil, and evaluated for chemical elements concentration. Since these areas also 
      differed in traffic density, NO(2) was measured by passive sampling. For a 
      comparative purpose, the elements were also determined in fingernail samples 
      collected from students living in the same areas. Accumulated elements were 
      determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and principal 
      component analysis (PCA) was used as a tool in exploratory data analysis to identify 
      possible sources. We found that Ba, Cd, Co, Cu, Mg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sb, Sr, V, and Zn 
      were at higher concentrations in tree barks in Area A, while Cd, Co, Cu, Mg, Mn, Ni, 
      and Sr were at higher levels in students' fingernails of Area A as well. 
      Furthermore, concentrations of elements found in barks were associated with those 
      identified in fingernails collected from students living in the same areas. PCA 
      demonstrated that vehicular traffic explained 66.4 % of the variance in tree bark 
      and 50.8 % of the variance in fingernails. NO(2) levels were significantly different 
      among the areas, what is consistent with their respective vehicular flow and 
      population density. In conclusion, we found conformance of elements levels 
      accumulated in barks and fingernails at three monitoring areas with different 
      profiles. The amount of traffic-related elements accumulated appears to be 
      associated with the degree of urbanization and vehicular flow. Overall, data 
      suggests a relationship between fingernails and tree bark as bioindicators of 
      exposure to metals from air pollution.

LID - 22482
AB  - Modern phenotyping and plant disease detection methods, based on optical sensors and 
      information technology, provide promising approaches to plant research and precision 
      farming. In particular, hyperspectral imaging have been found to reveal 
      physiological and structural characteristics in plants and to allow for tracking 
      physiological dynamics due to environmental effects. In this work, we present an 
      approach to plant phenotyping that integrates non-invasive sensors, computer vision, 
      as well as data mining techniques and allows for monitoring how plants respond to 
      stress. To uncover latent hyperspectral characteristics of diseased plants reliably 
      and in an easy-to-understand way, we "wordify" the hyperspectral images, i.e., we 
      turn the images into a corpus of text documents. Then, we apply probabilistic topic 
      models, a well-established natural language processing technique that identifies 
      content and topics of documents. Based on recent regularized topic models, we 
      demonstrate that one can track automatically the development of three foliar 
      diseases of barley. We also present a visualization of the topics that provides 
      plant scientists an intuitive tool for hyperspectral imaging. In short, our analysis 
      and visualization of characteristic topics found during symptom development and 
      disease progress reveal the hyperspectral language of plant diseases.

TI  - Relieving my discomforts safely: the experiences of discontinuing HRT among 
      menopausal women.
PG  - 2481-9
LID - 10.1111/jocn.12429 [doi]
AB  - AIM AND OBJECTIVES: To generate a descriptive theoretical framework about the 
      experiences of women who discontinued hormone replacement therapy. BACKGROUND: Some 
      menopausal women would depend on hormone replacement therapy for relieving their 
      menopausal symptoms. However, most of them feared of hormone replacement therapy's 
      side effects and tried to discontinue hormone replacement therapy immediately. How 
      did these women self-manage their discomforts without using dependent 
      medicine--hormone replacement therapy? There are few studies conducted on this 
      issue. DESIGN: A grounded theory research was applied. METHODS: Nineteen Taiwanese 
      women discontinuing hormone replacement therapy for three months, aged 45 to 67 
      years, participated in face-to-face audio-taped interviews. Data collection, and 
      coding of interviews, and data analysis occurred simultaneously. All conversations 
      were audio-recorded and then transcribed as verbatim text. The constant comparative 
      method was used to analyse the interview data. RESULTS: 'Relieving my discomforts 
      safely' was the core theme for describing and guiding the process of discontinuing 
      hormone replacement therapy. 'Immediately discontinuing hormone replacement 
      therapy--it would hurt my body' was identified as the antecedent condition. Analyses 
      showed five dimensions to the women's relieving my discomforts safely: (1) symptoms 
      bothered me again, (2) negative emotions, (3) learning to let it go, (4) trying to 
      use nonhormone replacement therapy or products and (5) choosing safely therapies as 
      first priority. Finally, some women would choose their suitable nonhormone 
      replacement therapy way, and some women would reuse hormone replacement therapy 
      cautiously. CONCLUSIONS: 'Relieving my discomforts safely' was the first-priority 
      consideration for the menopausal women discontinuing hormone replacement therapy. It 
      is the challenge to establish the health programme or management for helping these 
      women felt safety and security to relieve their menopausal symptoms by using hormone 
      replacement therapy or nonhormone replacement therapy. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL 
      PRACTICE: Healthcare providers need to empower women the rights of decision-making 
      of using hormone replacement therapy and assist them in monitoring their health 
      status to reduce their fear and uncertainty.

TI  - Rising prevalence of back pain in Austria: considering regional disparities.
PG  - 6-13
LID - 10.1007/s00508-015-0857-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Back pain is the most common form of musculoskeletal conditions and 
      leads to high health care costs. Information about geographic variations in highly 
      prevalent diseases/disorders represents important implications for public health 
      planning to face structural challenges. The present study aims to investigate 
      regional trends in the prevalence of back pain and the role of obesity and social 
      inequalities among Austrian adults. METHODS: A secondary data analysis based on five 
      nationally representative cross-sectional surveys (1973-2007) was carried out 
      (N = 178,818). Back pain was measured as self-reported presence. Obesity (BMI ≥ 30 
      kg/m²) was adjusted for self-report bias. For the regional analyses, Austria was 
      divided into Western, Central and Eastern Austria. A relative index of inequality 
      (RII) was computed to quantify the extent of social inequality. RESULTS: A 
      continuous rise in back pain prevalence was observed in the three regions and among 
      all investigated subgroups. In 2007 the age-standardised prevalence was similar in 
      Central (36.9 %), Western (35.2 %) and Eastern Austria (34.3 %). The absolute change 
      in back pain prevalence was highest among obese subjects in Central Austria (women: 
      + 29.8 %, men: + 32.5 %). RIIs were unstable during the study period and in 2007 
      highest in Eastern Austria. CONCLUSION: Variation and trends in back pain are not 
      attributable to geographic variation in Austria: an assumed East-West gradient in 
      Austria has not been confirmed. Nevertheless our study confirms that back pain 
      dramatically increased in all Austrian regions and investigated subgroups. This 
      worrying trend should be further monitored and public health interventions should be 
      implemented increasingly, especially among obese women and men.

TI  - A cohort study of therapeutic prescriptions after the end of phytotherapy drug 
      reimbursement by French Social Security.
PG  - 760-8

AB  - PURPOSE: The reimbursement of phytotherapy drugs for the treatment of mild anxiety 
      and insomnia ended in March 2006 in France. The aim of this study is to investigate 
      the short-term impact of stopping phytotherapy reimbursement. METHODS: We monitored 
      the prescriptions of 27,422 patients who received hypnotic and sedative phytotherapy 
      drug treatment at least once in the 12 months preceding the end of reimbursement and 
      made contact with their prescribing physician at least once in the following 12 
      months. A control cohort was recruited from patients fulfilling the same inclusion 
      criteria in the 24 months before de-reimbursement and their prescriptions in the 
      following 12 months were monitored. The impact of the end of reimbursement is 
      estimated comparing prescription switches in these cohorts. RESULTS: Before the end 
      of reimbursement, 7684 (28%) patients being prescribed delisted phytotherapy drugs 
      had the relevant drug marketing authorization approval (DMAA) indications. 
      Co-prescriptions of hypnotic and sedative drugs concerned 40% of patients. Of the 
      4646 DMAA patients exclusively prescribed phytotherapy, 640 (14%) switched to 
      hypnotic or sedative drugs only after the end of reimbursement, 3266 (70%) stopped 
      all treatments and 740 (16%) carried on with a non-reimbursed phytotherapy 
      prescription. When compared to the control cohort, patients exposed to 
      de-reimbursement were more likely to switch to psychotropic drugs (OR = 1.46). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Ending the reimbursement of common drugs on the basis of insufficient 
      evidence regarding their effectiveness or the low level of severity of their target 
      pathologies should be accompanied by information or advice to prescribing health 
      care actors.

      Population: Lessons Learned from A Study Using A Multi-modal Sensors Platform.

AB  - Agitation is one of the most common behavioural and psychological symptoms in people 
      living with dementia (PLwD). This behaviour can cause tremendous stress and anxiety 
      on family caregivers and healthcare providers. Direct observation of PLwD is the 
      traditional way to measure episodes of agitation. However, this method is 
      subjective, bias-prone and timeconsuming. Importantly, it does not predict the onset 
      of the agitation. Therefore, there is a need to develop a continuous monitoring 
      system that can detect and/or predict the onset of agitation. In this study, a 
      multi-modal sensor platform with video cameras, motion and door sensors, wristbands 
      and pressure mats were set up in a hospital-based dementia behavioural care unit to 
      develop a predictive system to identify the onset of agitation. The research team 
      faced several barriers in the development and initiation of the study, namely 
      addressing concerns about the study ethics, logistics and costs of study activities, 
      device design for PLwD and limitations of its use in the hospital. In this paper, 
      the strategies and methodologies that were implemented to address these challenges 
      are discussed for consideration by future researchers who will conduct similar 
      studies in a hospital setting.

TI  - Mefloquine induces oxidative stress and neurodegeneration in primary rat cortical 
      neurons.
PG  - 518-23
LID - 10.1016/j.neuro.2010.05.005 [doi]
AB  - Mefloquine is an effective antimalarial that can cause adverse neurological events 
      including headache, nausea, fatigue, insomnia, anxiety and depression. In this 
      study, we examined the oxidative stress response in primary rat cortical neurons 
      treated with mefloquine by quantifying oxidative stress markers glutathione (GSH) 
      and F(2)-isoprostanes (F(2)-isoPs). Furthermore, we examined whether mefloquine 
      induces synaptodendritic degeneration of primary rat cortical neurons. GSH was 
      quantified in cortical neurons after 24-h treatment with mefloquine (0, 1, 5, 10 
      microM) using monochlorobimane. F(2)-isoPs were quantified in cortical neurons after 
      24-h treatment with mefloquine (0, 1, 5, 10 microM) using a stable isotope dilution 
      method with detection by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and selective ion 
      monitoring. The concentration dependent decrease in GSH and the concomitant increase 
      of F(2)-isoPs indicates the presence of oxidative stress in primary rat cortical 
      neurons treated with mefloquine. Following a 24-h treatment with mefloquine, primary 
      rat cortical neurons (0, 5, 10 microM) were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Images 
      from eight optical sections covering a distance of 2.88 microm on the z-axis were 
      acquired using a confocal laser scanning unit. Traced images were analyzed with 
      NeuroExplorer, a neurophysiological data analysis package. Mefloquine induces a 
      concentration dependent decrease in the number of spines per neuron and the spine 
      density, suggesting that mefloquine induced oxidative stress may be associated with 
      the synaptodendritic degeneration. Together with previous work, there is strong 
      evidence that a relationship exists between calcium homeostasis disruption, ER 
      stress response, the oxidative stress response, and neurodegeneration. Understanding 
      how oxidative stress alters the morphology of cortical neurons treated with 
      mefloquine will provide further insight into the mechanism(s) related to clinically 
      observed adverse neurological events.

AB  - Wheat is one of the most important grain crop plants worldwide. Nitrogen (N) is an 
      essential macronutrient for the growth and development of wheat and exerts a marked 
      influence on its metabolites. To investigate the influence of low nitrogen stress on 
      various metabolites of the flag leaf of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), a metabolomic 
      analysis of two wheat cultivars under different induced nitrogen levels was 
      conducted during two important growth periods based on large-scale untargeted 
      metabolomic analysis using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole 
      time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF). Multivariate analyses-such as 
      principle components analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least square discriminant 
      analysis (OPLS-DA)-were used for data analysis. PCA yielded distinctive clustering 
      information among the samples, classifying the wheat flag samples into two 
      categories: those under normal N treatment and low N treatment. By processing 
      OPLS-DA, eleven secondary metabolites were shown to be responsible for classifying 
      the two groups. The secondary metabolites may be considered potential biomarkers of 
      low nitrogen stress. Chemical analyses showed that most of the identified secondary 
      metabolites were flavonoids and their related derivatives, such as iso-vitexin, 
      iso-orientin and methylisoorientin-2″-O-rhamnoside, etc. This study confirmed the 
      effect of low nitrogen stress on the metabolism of wheat, and revealed that the 
      accumulation of secondary metabolites is a response to abiotic stresses. Meanwhile, 
      we aimed to identify markers which could be used to monitor the nitrogen status of 
      wheat crops, presumably to guide appropriate fertilization regimens. Furthermore, 
      the UPLC-QTOF metabolic platform technology can be used to study metabolomic 
      variations of wheat under abiotic stresses.

AB  - The effects of two protocols (density gradient versus hypotonic lysis) used for 
      leukocyte isolation from three major lymphoid tissue of fish (head-kidney, spleen 
      and blood) were examined on some cell functional activities (tissue leucocytes 
      distributions, phagocytosis, basal and burst oxidative activities) classically used 
      to estimate the fish immune status. Experiments were conducted on roach (Rutilus 
      rutilus), a cyprinid fish model often studied in different eco-physiological 
      contexts (aquaculture, ecotoxicology …). All of immune endpoints were assessed 
      either immediately after cell isolation or after a 12 h of incubation in order to 
      observe if a post-isolation incubation may influence the leukocytes activities. 
      Compared to the density gradient, hypotonic lysis is associated with granulocytes 
      enrichments of cell suspensions. This is particularly true for leukocyte suspensions 
      isolated from head kidney where granulocytes are naturally abundant. However, 
      important variabilities in leukocyte distributions were observed in head kidney and 
      spleen cells samples obtained by the use of hypotonic lysis for two incubation 
      conditions used (no incubation or 12 h of incubation at 4 °C). The density gradient 
      protocol leads to a transitory increase in basal ROS production in spleen 
      lymphocytes and macrophages The blood leukocytes isolated by this same method 
      exhibit high basal oxidative activities after 12 h of incubation at 4 °C and for the 
      three leukocyte types (lymphocytes, monocytes and granulocytes). The hypotonic lysis 
      is associated with an increase in PMA-induced ROS production especially in head 
      kidney leukocytes. The increases in cell oxidative activities are consistent with 
      increases in granulocyte proportions observed in leukocyte suspensions obtained by 
      hypotonic lysis. Finally, the two protocols have no effect on leukocyte mortality 
      and phagocytic activity. Within limits of our experimental conditions, the spleen is 
      the organ whose leukocyte oxidative activities (stimulated or not) are only slightly 
      influenced by the methods used for leukocyte isolation. This is also the case for 
      the anterior kidney, but for this tissue, it is necessary to incubate the isolated 
      cells for 12 h at 4 °C before functional analyses. Each of the two methodologies 
      used has advantages and disadvantages. The hypotonic lysis allows to isolate a 
      greater variety of leukocytes types whereas the density gradient used ensures a 
      better stability of cells distributions over time. However, for the same fish 
      species and for the same tissue, the method used to isolate leukocytes influences 
      results and must be taken into consideration during acquired data analysis for 
      evaluation of fish immune status.

TI  - Heart rate-based window segmentation improves accuracy of classifying posttraumatic 
      stress disorder using heart rate variability measures.
PG  - 1061-1076
LID - 10.1088/1361-6579/aa6e9c [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Heart rate variability (HRV) characterizes changes in autonomic nervous 
      system function and varies with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In this study 
      we developed a classifier based on heart rate (HR) and HRV measures, and improved 
      classifier performance using a novel HR-based window segmentation. APPROACH: 
      Single-channel ECG data were collected from 23 subjects with current PTSD, and 25 
      control subjects with no history of PTSD over 24 h. RR intervals were derived from 
      these data, cleaned, and used to calculate HR and HRV metrics. These metrics were 
      used as features in a logistic regression classifier. Performance was assessed via 
      repeated random sub-sampling validation. To reduce noise and activity-related 
      effects, we calculated features from five non-overlapping ten-minute quiescent 
      segments of RR intervals defined by lowest HR, as well as random ten-minute segments 
      as a control. MAIN RESULTS: Using a combination of the four most predictive features 
      derived from quiescent segments we achieved a median area under the receiver 
      operating curve (AUC) of 0.86 on out-of-sample test set data. This was significantly 
      higher than the AUC using 24 h of data (0.72) or random segments (0.67). 
      SIGNIFICANCE: These results demonstrate our segmentation approach improves the 
      classification of PTSD from HR and HRV measures, and suggest the potential for 
      tracking PTSD illness severity via objective physiological monitoring. Future 
      studies should prospectively evaluate if classifier output changes significantly 
      with worsening or effective treatment of PTSD.

TI  - Covalent Labeling Denaturation Mass Spectrometry for Sensitive Localized Higher 
      Order Structure Comparisons.
PG  - 2478-88
LID - 10.1021/acs.analchem.5b04736 [doi]
AB  - Protein higher order structure (HOS) describes the three-dimensional folding 
      arrangement of a given protein and plays critical roles in structure/function 
      relationships. As such, it is a key product quality attribute that is monitored 
      during biopharmaceutical development. Covalent labeling of surface residues, 
      combined with mass spectrometry analysis, has increasingly played an important role 
      in characterizing localized protein HOS. Since the label can potentially induce 
      conformation changes, protocols generally use a small amount of label to ensure that 
      the integrity of the protein HOS is not disturbed. The present study, however, 
      describes a method that purposely uses high amounts of isobaric label (levels that 
      induce denaturation) to enhance the sensitivity and resolution for detecting 
      localized structural differences between two or more biological products. The method 
      proved to be highly discriminative, detecting differences in HOS affecting as little 
      as 2.5-5% of the molecular population, levels at which circular dichroism and 
      nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy fingerprinting, both gold standard HOS 
      techniques, were unable to adequately differentiate. The methodology was shown to 
      have comparable sensitivity to differential scanning calorimetry for detecting HOS 
      differences. In addition, the workflow presented herein can also quantify other 
      product attributes such as post-translational modifications and site-specific 
      glycosylation, using a single liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry 
      (LC-MS/MS) run with automated data analysis. We applied this technique to 
      characterize a large (>90 kDa), multiply glycosylated therapeutic protein under 
      different heat stress conditions and aggregation states.

TI  - Impact of a decision-support tool on decision making at the district level in Kenya.
PG  - 34
LID - 10.1186/1478-4505-11-34 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In many countries, the responsibility for planning and delivery of 
      health services is devolved to the subnational level. Health programs, however, 
      often fall short of efficient use of data to inform decisions. As a result, programs 
      are not as effective as they can be at meeting the health needs of the populations 
      they serve. In Kenya, a decision-support tool, the District Health Profile (DHP) 
      tool was developed to integrate data from health programs, primarily HIV, at the 
      district level and to enable district health management teams to review and monitor 
      program progress for specific health issues to make informed service delivery 
      decisions. METHODS: Thirteen in-depth interviews were conducted with ten tool users 
      and three non-users in six districts to qualitatively assess the process of 
      implementing the tool and its effect on data-informed decision making at the 
      district level. The factors that affected use or non-use of the tool were also 
      investigated. Respondents were selected via convenience sample from among those that 
      had been trained to use the DHP tool except for one user who was self-taught to use 
      the tool. Selection criteria also included respondents from urban districts with 
      significant resources as well as respondents from more remote, under-resourced 
      districts. RESULTS: Findings from the in-depth interviews suggest that among those 
      who used it, the DHP tool had a positive effect on data analysis, review, 
      interpretation, and sharing at the district level. The automated function of the 
      tool allowed for faster data sharing and immediate observation of trends that 
      facilitated data-informed decision making. All respondents stated that the DHP tool 
      assisted them to better target existing services in need of improvement and to plan 
      future services, thus positively influencing program improvement. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      paper stresses the central role that a targeted decision-support tool can play in 
      making data aggregation, analysis, and presentation easier and faster. The visual 
      synthesis of data facilitates the use of information in health decision making at 
      the district level of a health system and promotes program improvement. The 
      experience in Kenya can be applied to other countries that face challenges making 
      district-level, data-informed decisions with data from fragmented information 
      systems.

TI  - Work-related stress risk assessment in Italy: a methodological proposal adapted to 
      regulatory guidelines.
PG  - 95-9
LID - 10.1016/j.shaw.2013.05.002 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Work-related stress is one of the major causes of occupational ill 
      health. In line with the regulatory framework on occupational health and safety 
      (OSH), adequate models for assessing and managing risk need to be identified so as 
      to minimize the impact of this stress not only on workers' health, but also on 
      productivity. METHODS: After close analysis of the Italian and European reference 
      regulatory framework and work-related stress assessment and management models used 
      in some European countries, we adopted the UK Health and Safety Executive's (HSE) 
      Management Standards (MS) approach, adapting it to the Italian context in order to 
      provide a suitable methodological proposal for Italy. RESULTS: We have developed a 
      work-related stress risk assessment strategy, meeting regulatory requirements, now 
      available on a specific web platform that includes software, tutorials, and other 
      tools to assist companies in their assessments. CONCLUSION: This methodological 
      proposal is new on the Italian work-related stress risk assessment scene. Besides 
      providing an evaluation approach using scientifically validated instruments, it 
      ensures the active participation of occupational health professionals in each 
      company. The assessment tools provided enable companies not only to comply with the 
      law, but also to contribute to a database for monitoring and assessment and give 
      access to a reserved area for data analysis and comparisons.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The engineering of functional tissues is a complex multi-stage process, 
      the success of which depends on the careful control of culture conditions and 
      ultimately tissue maturation. To enable the efficient optimization of tissue 
      development protocols, techniques suitable for monitoring the effects of added 
      stimuli and induced tissue changes are needed. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, 
      we present the quantitative use of two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) and second 
      harmonic generation (SHG) as a noninvasive means to monitor the differentiation of 
      human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) using entirely endogenous sources of contrast. 
      We demonstrate that the individual fluorescence contribution from the intrinsic 
      cellular fluorophores NAD(P)H, flavoproteins and lipofuscin can be extracted from 
      TPEF images and monitored dynamically from the same cell population over time. Using 
      the redox ratio, calculated from the contributions of NAD(P)H and flavoproteins, we 
      identify distinct patterns in the evolution of the metabolic activity of hMSCs 
      maintained in either propagation, osteogenic or adipogenic differentiation media. 
      The differentiation of these cells is mirrored by changes in cell morphology 
      apparent in high resolution TPEF images and by the detection of collagen production 
      via SHG imaging. Finally, we find dramatic increases in lipofuscin levels in hMSCs 
      maintained at 20% oxygen vs. those in 5% oxygen, establishing the use of this 
      chromophore as a potential biomarker for oxidative stress. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: 
      In this study we demonstrate that it is possible to monitor the metabolic activity, 
      morphology, ECM production and oxidative stress of hMSCs in a non-invasive manner. 
      This is accomplished using generally available multiphoton microscopy equipment and 
      simple data analysis techniques, such that the method can widely adopted by 
      laboratories with a diversity of comparable equipment. This method therefore 
      represents a powerful tool, which enables researchers to monitor engineered tissues 
      and optimize culture conditions in a near real time manner.

TI  - Global LC/MS Metabolomics Profiling of Calcium Stressed and Immunosuppressant Drug 
      Treated Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
PG  - 1102-17
LID - 10.3390/metabo3041102 [doi]
AB  - Previous studies have shown that calcium stressed Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 
      challenged with immunosuppressant drugs FK506 and Cyclosporin A, responds with 
      comprehensive gene expression changes and attenuation of the generalized calcium 
      stress response. Here, we describe a global metabolomics workflow for investigating 
      the utility of tracking corresponding phenotypic changes. This was achieved by 
      efficiently analyzing relative abundance differences between intracellular 
      metabolite pools from wild-type and calcium stressed cultures, with and without 
      prior immunosuppressant drugs exposure. We used pathway database content from 
      WikiPathways and YeastCyc to facilitate the projection of our metabolomics profiling 
      results onto biological pathways. A key challenge was to increase the coverage of 
      the detected metabolites. This was achieved by applying both reverse phase (RP) and 
      aqueous normal phase (ANP) chromatographic separations, as well as electrospray 
      ionization (ESI) and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) sources for 
      detection in both ion polarities. Unsupervised principle component analysis (PCA) 
      and ANOVA results revealed differentiation between wild-type controls, calcium 
      stressed and immunosuppressant/calcium challenged cells. Untargeted data mining 
      resulted in 247 differentially expressed, annotated metabolites, across at least one 
      pair of conditions. A separate, targeted data mining strategy identified 187 
      differential, annotated metabolites. All annotated metabolites were subsequently 
      mapped onto curated pathways from YeastCyc and WikiPathways for interactive pathway 
      analysis and visualization. Dozens of pathways showed differential responses to 
      stress conditions based on one or more matches to the list of annotated metabolites 
      or to metabolites that had been identified further by MS/MS. The purine salvage, 
      pantothenate and sulfur amino acid pathways were flagged as being enriched, which is 
      consistent with previously published literature for transcriptomics analysis. Thus, 
      broad discovery-based data mining combined with targeted pathway projections can be 
      an important asset for rapidly distilling, testing and evaluating a large amount of 
      information for further investigation.

AB  - Chronotye is associated with age, sex, personality, and parental monitoring during 
      childhood. The evening type is associated with poor school performance, sleep 
      problems, anxious/depressive symptoms, tobacco smoking, caffeine consumption, 
      alcohol drinking, and suicidality in adolescents. The present study tested the 
      relationships between chronotype and a wide range of psychopathology and personality 
      traits among 2919 incoming undergraduate students. Each participant completed a 
      self-administered questionnaire that included demographics, plus the 
      Morningness-Eveningness (M-E) scale, Brief Symptom Rating Scale (BSRS), 
      Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire, and Maudesley Personality Inventory. The 
      t-score distribution of the M-E scale was used to form the morning (t-score >60, n = 
      419), evening (t-score <40, n = 371), and intermediate (40 ≤ t-score ≤ 60, n = 2129) 
      groups. Multivariable regression was employed for data analysis. For males, the 
      evening type scored higher on all subscales of the BSRS than the morning type, 
      except phobic anxiety. For females, the evening type had higher scores than the 
      other two types on all subscales, except in obsession/compulsion and phobic anxiety, 
      where the evening type only scored higher than the intermediate type. The evening 
      type of both sexes also scored higher than the morning type in novelty seeking, harm 
      avoidance, and neurotic personality characteristics, but lower than the morning type 
      in extraversion and social desirability. In reward dependence, the evening type 
      scored lowest for males, but there was no difference for females. The findings of 
      the evening type being associated with possible psychopathology and certain types of 
      personality have public health implications, that is, chronotype needs to be taken 
      into account in the development of mental health prevention programs and assessment 
      of and intervention for mental problems in young adults.

TI  - Impact of prolonged 48-h wireless capsule esophageal pH monitoring on diagnosis of 
      gastroesophageal reflux disease and evaluation of the relationship between symptoms 
      and reflux episodes.
PG  - 24-9
LID - S0004-28032011000100006 [pii]
AB  - CONTEXT: Gastroesophageal reflux disease is one of the most common digestive 
      diseases and an important cause of distress to patients. Diagnosis of this condition 
      can require ambulatory pH monitoring. OBJECTIVES: To determine the diagnostic yield 
      of a wireless ambulatory pH monitoring system of 48-hours, recording to diagnose 
      daily variability of abnormal esophageal acid exposure and its symptom association. 
      METHODS: A total of 100 consecutive patients with persistent reflux symptoms 
      underwent wireless pH capsule placement from 2004 to 2009. The wireless pH capsule 
      was deployed 5 cm proximal to the squamocolumnar junction after lower esophageal 
      sphincter was manometrically determined. The pH recordings over 48-h were obtained 
      after uploading data to a computer from the receiver that recorded pH signals from 
      the wireless pH capsule. The following parameters were analyzed: (1) percentual time 
      of distal esophageal acid exposure; (2) symptom association probability related to 
      acid reflux. The results between the first and the second day were compared, and the 
      diagnostic yield reached when the second day monitoring was included. RESULTS: 
      Successful pH data over 48-h was obtained in 95% of patients. Nearly one quarter of 
      patients experienced symptoms ranging from a foreign body sensation to chest pain. 
      Forty-eight hours pH data analysis was statistically significant when compared to 
      isolated analysis of day 1 and day 2. Study on day 2 identified seven patients 
      (30.4%) that would be missed if only day 1 was analyzed. Three patients (18.7%) out 
      of 16 patients with normal esophageal acid exposure on both days, showed positive 
      symptom association probability, which generated an increase in diagnostic yield of 
      43.4%. CONCLUSION: Esophageal pH monitoring with wireless capsule is safe, well 
      tolerated, does not require sedation. The extended 48-h period of study poses an 
      increased yield to diagnose gastroesophageal reflux disease patients.

TI  - Using sensor-fusion and machine-learning algorithms to assess acute pain in 
      non-verbal infants: a study protocol.
PG  - e039292
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2020-039292 [doi]
LID - e039292
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Objective pain assessment in non-verbal populations is clinically 
      challenging due to their inability to express their pain via self-report. Repetitive 
      exposures to acute or prolonged pain lead to clinical instability, with long-term 
      behavioural and cognitive sequelae in newborn infants. Strong analgesics are also 
      associated with medical complications, potential neurotoxicity and altered brain 
      development. Pain scores performed by bedside nurses provide subjective, 
      observer-dependent assessments rather than objective data for infant pain 
      management; the required observations are labour intensive, difficult to perform by 
      a nurse who is concurrently performing the procedure and increase the nursing 
      workload. Multimodal pain assessment, using sensor-fusion and machine-learning 
      algorithms, can provide a patient-centred, context-dependent, observer-independent 
      and objective pain measure. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In newborns undergoing painful 
      procedures, we use facial electromyography to record facial muscle activity-related 
      infant pain, ECG to examine heart rate (HR) changes and HR variability, 
      electrodermal activity (skin conductance) to measure catecholamine-induced palmar 
      sweating, changes in oxygen saturations and skin perfusion, and 
      electroencephalography using active electrodes to assess brain activity in real 
      time. This multimodal approach has the potential to improve the accuracy of pain 
      assessment in non-verbal infants and may even allow continuous pain monitoring at 
      the bedside. The feasibility of this approach will be evaluated in an observational 
      prospective study of clinically required painful procedures in 60 preterm and term 
      newborns, and infants aged 6 months or less. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The 
      Institutional Review Board of the Stanford University approved the protocol. Study 
      findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals, presented at scientific 
      meetings, taught via webinars, podcasts and video tutorials, and listed on 
      academic/scientific websites. Future studies will validate and refine this approach 
      using the minimum number of sensors required to assess neonatal/infant pain. TRIAL

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Osteoporosis is a major health concern in postmenopausal women, and 
      oxidative stress contributes to the development of bone loss. Cellular studies and 
      ovariectomised rat model mimicking bone loss in postmenopausal women show the 
      bone-protective effect of tocotrienols (TTs) with antioxidant capability. We aim to 
      access the safety and efficacy of TT consumption for bone health in postmenopausal 
      women. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In this 12-week randomised double-blinded 
      placebo-controlled trial for the effects of dietary TT supplementation in 
      postmenopausal women, postmenopausal women aged 45 years and older with at least 
      1 year after menopause and bone mineral density T-score at the spine and/or hip 2.5 
      or more below the reference values will be randomly assigned to 3 daily supplements: 
      (1) placebo group receiving 860 mg olive oil, (2) low TT group receiving 430 mg of 
      70% pure TTs (containing 300 mg TT) and (3) high TT group receiving 860 mg of 70% 
      pure TTs (600 mg TT). The primary outcome measure will be urinary N-terminal 
      telopeptide. The secondary outcome measures will be serum bone-specific alkaline 
      phosphatase, receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand, osteoprotegerin, 
      urinary 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine and quality of life. At 0, 6 and 12 weeks, the 
      following will be assessed: (1) primary and secondary outcome measures; (2) serum TT 
      and tocopherol concentrations; (3) physical activity and food frequency 
      questionnaires. Liver function will be monitored every 6 weeks for safety. 
      'Intent-to-treat' principle will be employed for data analysis. A model of repeated 
      measurements with random effect error terms will be applied. Analysis of covariance, 
      χ(2) analysis and regression will be used for comparisons. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: 
      This study was approved by the Bioethics Committee of the Texas Tech University 
      Health Sciences Center. The findings of this trial will be submitted to a 
      peer-reviewed journal in the areas of bone or nutrition and international 
      conferences. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT02058420; results.

      inferior vena cava diameter?

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: Patients in the third trimester of pregnancy presenting to the 
      emergency department (ED) with hypotension are routinely placed in the left lateral 
      tilt (LLT) position to relieve inferior vena cava (IVC) compression from the gravid 
      uterus thereby increasing venous return. However, the relationship between patient 
      position and proximal intrahepatic IVC filling has never assessed directly. This 
      study set out to determine the effect of LLT position on intrahepatic IVC diameter 
      in third trimester patients under real-time visualization with ultrasound. METHODS: 
      This prospective observational study on the labor and delivery floor of a large 
      urban academic teaching hospital enrolled patients between 30 and 42 weeks estimated 
      gestational age from August 2011 to March 2012. Patients were placed in three 
      different positions: supine, LLT, and right lateral tilt (RLT). After the patient 
      was in each position for at least 3 min, IVC ultrasound using the intercostal window 
      was performed by one of three study sonologists. Maternal and fetal hemodynamics 
      were also monitored and recorded in each position. RESULTS: A total of 26 patients 
      were enrolled with one excluded from data analysis due to inability to obtain IVC 
      measurements. The median IVC maximum diameter was 1.26 cm (95% confidence interval 
      [CI] 1.13-1.55) in LLT compared to 1.13 cm (95% CI 0.89-1.41) in supine, p=0.01. 
      When comparing each individual patient's LLT to supine measurement, LLT lead to an 
      increase in maximum IVC diameter in 76% (19/25) of patients with the average LLT 
      measurement 29% (95% confidence interval 10-48%) larger. Six patients had the 
      largest maximum IVC measurement in the supine position. No patients experienced any 
      hemodynamic instability or distress during the study. CONCLUSION: IVC ultrasound is 
      feasible in late pregnancy and demonstrates an increase in diameter with LLT 
      positioning. However, a quarter of patients had a decrease in IVC diameter with 
      tilting and, instead, had the largest IVC diameter in the supine position suggesting 
      that uterine compression of the IVC may not occur universally. IVC assessment at the 
      bedside may be a useful adjunct in determining optimal positioning for resuscitation 
      of third trimester patients.

AB  - Osteoporotic fractures in men are an increasing public health problem. Male 
      osteoporosis is often a low-prioritized issue, however. To examine men's experiences 
      with osteoporosis and how they handle osteoporosis in their everyday lives, the 
      authors collected data from four focus groups with a total of 16 men aged 51 to 82 
      years diagnosed with osteoporosis. Critical psychology was used as a theoretical 
      framework for the data analysis, which aimed to elicit information about the men's 
      daily lives. The men handled osteoporosis in different ways using different 
      strategies. The authors found patterns that resonated with the social construction 
      of hegemonic masculinity as displayed through the men's fear of weakness and 
      endurance through physical activity, as well as identity construction through active 
      decision making in relation to health. Understanding and implementation of these 
      issues is necessary in the development of preventive, screening, and monitoring 
      strategies, as well as in the clinical care of men with osteoporosis.

      Creatinine case study.
PG  - 73-88
LID - 10.1177/1460458213503646 [doi]
AB  - Many medical organizations have implemented electronic health record (EHR) and 
      health information exchange (HIE) networks to improve medical decision-making. This 
      study evaluated the contribution of EHR and HIE networks to physicians by 
      investigating whether health information technology can lead to more efficient 
      admission decisions by reducing redundant admissions in the stressful environment of 
      emergency. Log-files were retrieved from an integrative and interoperable EHR that 
      serves seven main Israeli hospitals. The analysis was restricted to a group of 
      patients seen in the emergency departments who were administered a Creatinine test. 
      The assessment of the contribution of EHR to admission decisions used various 
      statistical analyses and track log-file analysis. We showed that using the EHR 
      contributes to more efficient admission decisions and reduces the number of 
      avoidable admissions. In particular, there was a reduction in readmissions when 
      patient history was viewed. Using EHR can help respond to the international problem 
      of avoidable hospital readmissions.

TI  - Using DNA microarrays to assay part function.
PG  - 75-113
LID - 10.1016/B978-0-12-385075-1.00004-4 [doi]
AB  - In recent years, the capability of synthetic biology to design large genetic 
      circuits has dramatically increased due to rapid advances in DNA synthesis 
      technology and development of tools for large-scale assembly of DNA fragments. Large 
      genetic circuits require more components (parts), especially regulators such as 
      transcription factors, sigma factors, and viral RNA polymerases to provide increased 
      regulatory capability, and also devices such as sensors, receivers, and signaling 
      molecules. All these parts may have a potential impact upon the host that needs to 
      be considered when designing and fabricating circuits. DNA microarrays are a 
      well-established technique for global monitoring of gene expression and therefore 
      are an ideal tool for systematically assessing the impact of expressing parts of 
      genetic circuits in host cells. Knowledge of part impact on the host enables the 
      user to design circuits from libraries of parts taking into account their potential 
      impact and also to possibly modify the host to better tolerate stresses induced by 
      the engineered circuit. In this chapter, we present the complete methodology of 
      performing microarrays from choice of array platform, experimental design, preparing 
      samples for array hybridization, and associated data analysis including 
      preprocessing, normalization, clustering, identifying significantly differentially 
      expressed genes, and interpreting the data based on known biology. With these 
      methodologies, we also include lists of bioinformatic resources and tools for 
      performing data analysis. The aim of this chapter is to provide the reader with the 
      information necessary to be able to systematically catalog the impact of genetic 
      parts on the host and also to optimize the operation of fully engineered genetic 
      circuits.

TI  - The Extended ToxTracker Assay Discriminates Between Induction of DNA Damage, 
      Oxidative Stress, and Protein Misfolding.
PG  - 190-203
LID - 10.1093/toxsci/kfv323 [doi]
AB  - Chemical exposure of cells may damage biomolecules, cellular structures, and 
      organelles thereby jeopardizing cellular homeostasis. A multitude of defense 
      mechanisms have evolved that can recognize specific types of damaged molecules and 
      will initiate distinct cellular programs aiming to remove the damage inflicted and 
      prevent cellular havoc. As a consequence, quantitative assessment of the activity of 
      the cellular stress responses may serve as a sensitive reporter for the induction of 
      specific types of damage. We have previously developed the ToxTracker assay, a 
      mammalian stem cell-based genotoxicity assay employing two green fluorescent protein 
      reporters specific for DNA damage and oxidative stress. We have now expanded the 
      ToxTracker assay with an additional four reporter cell lines to include monitoring 
      of additional stress signaling pathways. This panel of six green fluorescent protein 
      reporters is able to discriminate between different primary reactivity of chemicals 
      being their ability to react with DNA and block DNA replication, induce oxidative 
      stress, activate the unfolded protein response, or cause a general P53-dependent 
      cellular stress response. Extensive validation using the compound library suggested 
      by the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM) and a large 
      panel of reference chemicals shows that the ToxTracker assay has an outstanding 
      sensitivity and specificity. In addition, we developed Toxplot, a dedicated software 
      tool for automated data analysis and graphical representation of the test results. 
      Rapid and reliable identification by the ToxTracker assay of specific biological 
      reactivity can significantly improve in vitro human hazard assessment of chemicals.

AB  - The risk of death by suicide in individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) 
      is largely unknown. Previous studies have been small and methodologically flawed. We 
      analyzed data from the Swedish national registers to estimate the risk of suicide in 
      OCD and identify the risk and protective factors associated with suicidal behavior 
      in this group. We used a matched case-cohort design to estimate the risk of deaths 
      by suicide and attempted suicide in individuals diagnosed with OCD, compared with 
      matched general population controls (1:10). Cox regression models were used to study 
      predictors of suicidal behavior. We identified 36 788 OCD patients in the Swedish 
      National Patient Register between 1969 and 2013. Of these, 545 had died by suicide 
      and 4297 had attempted suicide. In unadjusted models, individuals with OCD had an 
      increased risk of both dying by suicide (odds ratio (OR)=9.83 (95% confidence 
      interval (CI), 8.72-11.08)) and attempting suicide (OR=5.45 (95% CI, 5.24-5.67)), 
      compared with matched controls. After adjusting for psychiatric comorbidities, the 
      risk was reduced but remained substantial for both death by suicide and attempted 
      suicide. Within the OCD cohort, a previous suicide attempt was the strongest 
      predictor of death by suicide. Having a comorbid personality or substance use 
      disorder also increased the risk of suicide. Being a woman, higher parental 
      education and having a comorbid anxiety disorder were protective factors. We 
      conclude that patients with OCD are at a substantial risk of suicide. Importantly, 
      this risk remains substantial after adjusting for psychiatric comorbidities. Suicide 
      risk should be carefully monitored in patients with OCD.

TI  - Facial Video-Based Photoplethysmography to Detect HRV at Rest.
PG  - 474-80
LID - 10.1055/s-0034-1398530 [doi]
AB  - Our aim is to demonstrate the usefulness of photoplethysmography (PPG) for analyzing 
      heart rate variability (HRV) using a standard 5-min test at rest with paced 
      breathing, comparing the results with real RR intervals and testing supine and 
      sitting positions. Simultaneous recordings of R-R intervals were conducted with a 
      Polar system and a non-contact PPG, based on facial video recording on 20 
      individuals. Data analysis and editing were performed with individually designated 
      software for each instrument. Agreement on HRV parameters was assessed with 
      concordance correlations, effect size from ANOVA and Bland and Altman plots. For 
      supine position, differences between video and Polar systems showed a small effect 
      size in most HRV parameters. For sitting position, these differences showed a 
      moderate effect size in most HRV parameters. A new procedure, based on the pixels 
      that contained more heart beat information, is proposed for improving the 
      signal-to-noise ratio in the PPG video signal. Results were acceptable in both 
      positions but better in the supine position. Our approach could be relevant for 
      applications that require monitoring of stress or cardio-respiratory health, such as 
      effort/recuperation states in sports.

TI  - Findings from the Families on Track Intervention Pilot Trial for Children with Fetal 
      Alcohol Spectrum Disorders and Their Families.
PG  - 1340-1351
LID - 10.1111/acer.13408 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are at high 
      risk for costly, debilitating mental health problems and secondary conditions, such 
      as school disruption, trouble with the law, and substance use. The study objective 
      was to pilot a multicomponent intervention designed to prevent secondary conditions 
      in children with FASD and improve family adaptation. METHODS: Thirty children with 
      FASD or prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) (ages 4 to 8) and their primary caregivers 
      were enrolled. Families were randomized to either the Families on Track Integrated 
      Preventive Intervention or an active control of neuropsychological assessment and 
      personalized community referrals. The 30-week intervention integrates scientifically 
      validated bimonthly, in-home parent behavioral consultation, and weekly child skills 
      groups. Outcomes measured at baseline and follow-up postintervention included 
      intervention satisfaction, child emotional and behavioral functioning, child 
      self-esteem, caregiver knowledge of FASD and advocacy, caregiver attitudes, use of 
      targeted parenting practices, perceived family needs met, social support, and 
      self-care. Data analysis emphasized calculation of effect sizes and was supplemented 
      with analysis of variance techniques. RESULTS: Analyses indicated that families 
      participating in the intervention reported high program satisfaction. Relative to 
      comparison group outcomes, the intervention was associated with medium-to-large 
      effects for child emotion regulation, self-esteem, and anxiety. Medium-sized 
      improvements in disruptive behavior were observed for both groups. Medium and large 
      effects were seen for important caregiver outcomes: knowledge of FASD and advocacy, 
      attributions of behavior, use of antecedent strategies, parenting efficacy, family 
      needs met, social support, and self-care. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study yielded 
      promising findings from the multicomponent Families on Track Integrated Preventive 
      Intervention for child and caregiver outcomes. An important next step is to complete 
      a randomized control trial of the Families on Track Program with a larger sample 
      fully representative of this underserved clinical population with built-in study of 
      implementation parameters.

AB  - In health monitoring applications of composite materials, the health state of 
      specimens is often evaluated using naturally occurring and simulated Acoustic 
      Emission stress waves. For such applications, identifying the arrival times of the 
      extensional and flexural wave modes from acquired signals is a crucial step, and 
      must be performed reliably and potentially on large sets of signals. This article 
      proposes using the wavelet decomposition of a signal to develop a fast, algorithmic 
      and automated approach to estimate the arrival times of the extensional and flexural 
      wave modes. Algorithms are developed that estimate the two arrival times using 
      wavelet decomposition data, and which can be employed to consistently and reliably 
      identify the arrival times from large sets of signals iteratively. MATLAB scripts to 
      automatically execute the algorithms are also developed, and are made available 
      online.

LID - 10.1177/1043659609360848 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to describe the experiences of Native 
      American nurses working in their tribal communities to address retention. DESIGN: An 
      interpretive phenomenological study guided by a Native American research agenda and 
      a Native American nursing practice model. METHODS: In-depth interviews with nine 
      Native American nurses were conducted. Data analysis used interpretive 
      phenomenological procedures including an iterative process with Native American 
      consultants and researchers to develop themes. CONCLUSIONS: Native American nurses 
      experienced a great deal of stress and illness as they attempted to fulfill their 
      mission to help their people. The three themes were: (a) paying the price to fulfill 
      my mission, (b) being and connecting holistically, and (c) transcending the system. 
      Recommendations include strategies for nurse educators, tracking the ethnicity of 
      nurses in each Indian Health Service area, documenting their reasons for leaving, 
      and conducting further research to develop community-based interventions to improve 
      retention.

TI  - A case of mistaken identity? The role of injury representations in chronic 
      musculoskeletal pain.
PG  - 1552-63
LID - 10.3109/09638288.2012.748835 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To explore how patients construe bodily injury, examine how injury 
      representations change over the course of a rehabilitation program and how injury 
      representations influence adaptation and recovery trajectories. METHODS: A case 
      study method was used with qualitative interviews as the primary data source. 
      Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted three times over the course of 
      a 12-week intensive interdisciplinary occupational rehabilitation program with one 
      interview 1 month following discharge. To capture changes in rehabilitation 
      trajectories, data analysis employed a narrative approach informed by Bury 
      (progression, regression, and stability) and Frank's (chaos, restitution, and quest) 
      approaches. RESULTS: Sixteen patients (10 men and 6 women) were disabled as a result 
      of persistent pain and impairment from a variety of work injuries participated. 
      Progression/restitution narratives were characterized by the transformation of bone 
      and nerve problems to include soft tissue elements. These participants expanded 
      their scope of injury representations and appraisal to include neurobiological 
      aspects of chronic pain and dimensions of psychosocial well-being, and linked 
      diagnostic representations to self-management strategies in a functional manner. 
      CONCLUSION: Body representations of injury morphology and pain mechanisms are 
      important objects of fear and acceptance for injury recovery. Active strategies that 
      encourage a "hands on" understanding of diagnosis may prove most effective in 
      treating persistent pain. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION: Patient representations 
      of pain and body injury are windows into the personal experience of individuals with 
      chronic musculoskeletal pain. When patients enter programs, practitioners need to 
      assess what the patient believes is wrong with their body and what will be helpful 
      in rectifying the problem. Based on their initial assessment, practitioners need to 
      direct education and activity toward shifting patient beliefs to include elements of 
      soft tissue and a broader scope of pain sensitization and psychological impact. 
      Activity-based intervention is essential for creating coherence between injury and 
      pain representations and coping action. During rehabilitation, practitioners need to 
      monitor patient beliefs about their injury. Shifting beliefs are signs that the 
      patient is adopting a more adaptive cognitive stance toward their injury. Lack of 
      movement indicates that the message is not getting through and the approach needs to 
      be modified. When working with patients to transform beliefs, a collaborative 
      approach might be best to increase trust and reduce reactance.

      temporally observable physical and behavioral information.

AB  - It is believed that anomalous mental states such as stress and anxiety not only 
      cause suffering for the individuals, but also lead to tragedies in some extreme 
      cases. The ability to predict the mental state of an individual at both current and 
      future time periods could prove critical to healthcare practitioners. Currently, the 
      practical way to predict an individual's mental state is through mental examinations 
      that involve psychological experts performing the evaluations. However, such methods 
      can be time and resource consuming, mitigating their broad applicability to a wide 
      population. Furthermore, some individuals may also be unaware of their mental states 
      or may feel uncomfortable to express themselves during the evaluations. Hence, their 
      anomalous mental states could remain undetected for a prolonged period of time. The 
      objective of this work is to demonstrate the ability of using advanced machine 
      learning based approaches to generate mathematical models that predict current and 
      future mental states of an individual. The problem of mental state prediction is 
      transformed into the time series forecasting problem, where an individual is 
      represented as a multivariate time series stream of monitored physical and 
      behavioral attributes. A personalized mathematical model is then automatically 
      generated to capture the dependencies among these attributes, which is used for 
      prediction of mental states for each individual. In particular, we first illustrate 
      the drawbacks of traditional multivariate time series forecasting methodologies such 
      as vector autoregression. Then, we show that such issues could be mitigated by using 
      machine learning regression techniques which are modified for capturing temporal 
      dependencies in time series data. A case study using the data from 150 human 
      participants illustrates that the proposed machine learning based forecasting 
      methods are more suitable for high-dimensional psychological data than the 
      traditional vector autoregressive model in terms of both magnitude of error and 
      directional accuracy. These results not only present a successful usage of machine 
      learning techniques in psychological studies, but also serve as a building block for 
      multiple medical applications that could rely on an automated system to gauge 
      individuals' mental states.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) impacts quality of life (QoL). 
      Psychological factors influence the course of the disease and should be targeted for 
      intervention. METHODS: Our study was a prospective, randomised control trial. 
      Fifty-six outpatients were randomly chosen and allocated to a treatment group or a 
      waiting-list control group. Treatment group patients attended three 
      relaxation-training sessions and received an audio disc for home practice. 
      Evaluations performed pre and post-treatment: state anxiety was assessed with the 
      State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, QoL with the IBD Questionnaire. The Visual Analogue 
      Scale assessed pain, depression, stress and mood. Patients completed a symptom 
      monitoring diary. The control group's symptoms were monitored without study-related 
      treatment. RESULTS: Thirty-nine subjects completed the study and were included in 
      the data analysis. Following the relaxation-training intervention, the treatment 
      group's (n = 18) measured results showed a statistically significant improvement as 
      compared to the control group (n = 21) (time by treatment interaction): anxiety 
      levels decreased (p < 0.01), QoL and mood improved (p < 0.05), while levels of pain 
      and stress decreased (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate IBD patients may 
      benefit from relaxation training in their holistic care. New studies as well as 
      further investigation of the subject are warranted.

TI  - Effects of Intranasal Oxytocin on Emotion Regulation in Insecure Adolescents: Study 
      Protocol for a Double-Blind, Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - e206
LID - e206
AB  - BACKGROUND: Emotional dysregulation and impaired attachment are potential 
      contributors to the development of psychopathology in adolescence. This raises the 
      question of whether oxytocin (OT), the paradigmatic "attachment hormone," may be 
      beneficial in such contexts. Recent evidence suggests that intranasal administration 
      of OT increases affiliative behavior, including trust and empathy. OT may also 
      facilitate social reciprocity by attenuating the stress response to interpersonal 
      conflict. To date, few studies have investigated the effects of intranasal oxytocin 
      (IN-OT) on neurophysiological emotion regulation strategies in healthy adolescents, 
      particularly during parent-adolescent interaction. To understand these mechanisms, 
      our study will examine the effects of IN-OT on emotion regulation in adolescents 
      during parent-adolescent stressful interactions, and on each adolescent's visual and 
      neurophysiological strategies when visualizing attachment-related pictures. We 
      hypothesize that IN-OT will influence psychophysiological outcomes under conditions 
      of stress. We predict that IN-OT will momentarily increase feelings of safety and 
      attenuate stress and hostile behavior during conflict situations. OT may also 
      enhance attachment security by increasing comfort and proximity-seeking, and 
      reducing neurophysiological hyperactivation. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study 
      is to evaluate the effects of IN-OT on insecure adolescents by studying their 
      behavior and discourse during a disagreement with one of their parents. Their 
      neurophysiological responses to pictures eliciting attachment-related emotions and 
      their visual exploration strategies will also be investigated. METHODS: In this 
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-group design, 60 healthy male 
      adolescents classified as insecurely attached will receive 24 international units 
      (IU) of IN-OT versus placebo (PB), 45 minutes before the experimental tasks. Each 
      adolescent will then be invited to engage in an experimental conflict discussion 
      with one of his parents. The conflict session will be videotaped and coded for 
      verbal and non-verbal interaction behavior, using the Goal-Corrected Partnership in 
      Adolescence Coding System (GPACS). Each adolescent will then be asked to visualize 
      attachment-related pictures on a screen. Eye-tracking (ET) and neurophysiological 
      responses, including electrodermal activity (EDA) and heart rate (HR), will be 
      recorded simultaneously and continuously during attachment-related picture viewing 
      (Besançon Affective Picture Set-Adolescents, BAPS-Ado). RESULTS: Enrollment for the 
      study was completed in May 2016. Data analysis commenced in July 2016. Study results 
      will be submitted for publication in the winter of 2017. CONCLUSIONS: OT is a 
      complex molecule with many facets that are not yet fully understood. This 
      experimental protocol will increase scientific and clinical knowledge of emotion 
      regulation skills in insecure adolescents by assessing the impact of IN-OT on 
      parent-adolescent interaction and on the visual processing of attachment-related 
      emotions. Positive results could lead to therapeutic uses of IN-OT to treat emotion 
      dysregulation in adolescence.

TI  - Long-term outcome of children receiving antiretroviral treatment in rural South 
      Africa: substantial virologic failure on first-line treatment.
PG  - 52-6
LID - 10.1097/INF.0b013e3181ed2af3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Long-term (>12 months follow-up) virologic data of children receiving 
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Sub-Saharan Africa are limited. Data from rural 
      areas are especially scarce. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term 
      virologic outcome of a pediatric cohort in rural South Africa. METHODS: We performed 
      a retrospective, observational cohort study, including children who initiated ART at 
      least 1 year before data-analysis. Regular monitoring, including HIV-RNA testing, 
      was performed. Genotypic resistance testing was done for children with virologic 
      failure (HIV-RNA >1000 copies/mL). Logistic regression analysis was used to 
      determine predictors of virologic failure. RESULTS: A total of 101 children were 
      included. Median duration since beginning ART was 31 months. Overall patient 
      retention-rate was 76% (77/101), with early mortality being the main cause of 
      attrition (13/24, 54%). Initial immunologic and virologic responses were excellent. 
      However, 38% (31/81) of children subsequently experienced virologic failure. 
      Correlation between virologic failure and immunologic decline was nearly absent. At 
      the time of failure, multiple non-nucleoside reverse transcription 
      inhibitor-associated mutations were observed in 52% (12/23) of children. No definite 
      predictors of virologic failure could be determined. CONCLUSIONS: ART provides 
      significant benefits for children in this rural African setting, but the finding 
      that a large proportion of children had virologic failure and developed major 
      drug-resistance mutations on first-line ART is worrying. Causes of failure need to 
      be analyzed and effective prevention strategies are needed. Because of the lack of a 
      correlation between immunologic and virologic failure, treatment failure generally 
      stays unnoticed in settings where HIV-RNA testing is not available.

TI  - An interpretive phenomenological study of Chinese mothers' experiences of constant 
      vigilance in caring for a hospitalized sick child.
PG  - 1808-18
LID - 10.1111/jan.12042 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To examine Chinese mothers' experience of caring for their hospitalized sick 
      child. BACKGROUND: Engaging the mother in providing care for a hospitalized sick 
      child is considered one of the key elements for high-quality care in advanced 
      paediatric nursing. There is evidence that a mother's belief in her capacity to 
      manage stressful situations could improve the nurse-parent relationship because they 
      might play an important role in protecting mothers against heightened stress during 
      crisis situation. DESIGN: An interpretive phenomenological approach involving 
      semi-structured interview and thematic analysis was used. METHOD: Fifteen interviews 
      were conducted in Hong Kong, China from April 2009-January 2010, with 15 mothers 
      caring for their hospitalized sick children with acute injury or illness. Crist and 
      Tanner's circular process of hermeneutic interpretive phenomenology was chosen to 
      guide the data analysis. FINDINGS: The prevailing concept identified through 
      analysis was the 'constant vigilance' that mothers developed. Interpretation of data 
      resulted in the identification of four key themes: 'being sensitive to others', 
      'providing helping hands', 'monitoring health conditions', and 'maintaining 
      dialogues'. The findings highlight Chinese mothers' desire for participation in 
      caring for their hospitalized child, their unexpressed needs for communication, and 
      concern about being uncared by the busy health professionals, which affect their 
      care for the child's health outcomes. CONCLUSION: The findings facilitate the 
      development of family-centred care focuses on partnership of care between the nurse 
      and family to enhance the Chinese family's active and participatory role.

TI  - The effects of supine and prone positions on oxygenation in premature infants 
      undergoing mechanical ventilation.
PG  - 229-33
AB  - BACKGROUND: Since the use of high concentrations of oxygen in infants may lead to 
      chronic lung problems, using proper methods of care in infants under mechanical 
      ventilation is one of the most important measures in NICU. This study aimed to 
      investigate the effects of prone and supine positions on oxygenation (SPO(2)) in 
      premature infants under mechanical ventilation and comparing infants' oxygenation in 
      the two positions. METHODS: In across over non randomized clinical trial study, 32 
      preterm infants under mechanical ventilation who had inclusion criteria were 
      enrolled in simple convenient method. Firstly, they were placed in supine position 
      for 120 minutes and further in prone position for 120 minutes .Their SPO(2) were 
      monitored by pulse oximeter continuously and was recorded every minute. Data 
      analysis was done using Software SPSS(15) by ANOVA test and post hoc test. RESULTS: 
      The data showed that during 120 minutes of exposure of infants in each position 
      there were no significant changes in SPO(2). In addition, the SPO(2) levels in the 
      prone position were significantly higher than the SPO(2) levels in the supine 
      position from 15(th) minute to 120(th) minute (to the end). CONCLUSIONS: Neonatal 
      positioning in prone position is a simple, non-invasive, and free of charge method 
      that could lead to improve oxygenation in infants undergoing mechanical ventilation.

TI  - Identifying Time Periods of Minimal Thermal Gradient for Temperature-Driven 
      Structural Health Monitoring.
LID - 10.3390/s18030734 [doi]
LID - 734
AB  - Temperature changes play a large role in the day to day structural behavior of 
      structures, but a smaller direct role in most contemporary Structural Health 
      Monitoring (SHM) analyses. Temperature-Driven SHM will consider temperature as the 
      principal driving force in SHM, relating a measurable input temperature to 
      measurable output generalized strain (strain, curvature, etc.) and generalized 
      displacement (deflection, rotation, etc.) to create three-dimensional signatures 
      descriptive of the structural behavior. Identifying time periods of minimal thermal 
      gradient provides the foundation for the formulation of the 
      temperature-deformation-displacement model. Thermal gradients in a structure can 
      cause curvature in multiple directions, as well as non-linear strain and stress 
      distributions within the cross-sections, which significantly complicates data 
      analysis and interpretation, distorts the signatures, and may lead to unreliable 
      conclusions regarding structural behavior and condition. These adverse effects can 
      be minimized if the signatures are evaluated at times when thermal gradients in the 
      structure are minimal. This paper proposes two classes of methods based on the 
      following two metrics: (i) the range of raw temperatures on the structure, and (ii) 
      the distribution of the local thermal gradients, for identifying time periods of 
      minimal thermal gradient on a structure with the ability to vary the tolerance of 
      acceptable thermal gradients. The methods are tested and validated with data 
      collected from the Streicker Bridge on campus at Princeton University.

TI  - Nano electrospray gas-phase electrophoretic mobility molecular analysis (nES GEMMA) 
      of liposomes: applicability of the technique for nano vesicle batch control.
PG  - 6042-6050
AB  - Liposomes are biodegradable nanoparticle vesicles consisting of a lipid bilayer 
      encapsulating an aqueous core. Entrapped cargo material is shielded from the 
      extra-vesicular medium and sustained release of encapsulated material can be 
      achieved. However, application of liposomes as nano-carriers demands their 
      characterization concerning size and size distribution, particle-number 
      concentration, occurrence of vesicle building blocks in solution and determination 
      of the resulting vesicle encapsulation capacity. These questions can be targeted via 
      gas-phase electrophoretic mobility molecular analysis (GEMMA) based on a nano 
      electrospray (nES) charge-reduction source. This instrument separates single-charged 
      nanoparticles in the gas-phase according to size in a high-laminar sheath-flow by 
      means of an orthogonal, tunable electric field. nES GEMMA analysis enables to 
      confirm liposome integrity after passage through the instrument (in combination with 
      atomic force microscopy) as well as to exclude vesicle aggregation. Additionally, 
      nanoparticle diameters at peak apexes and size distribution data are obtained. 
      Differences of hydrodynamic and dry particle diameter values, as well as the effect 
      of number- and mass-based concentration data analysis on obtained liposome diameters 
      are shown. Furthermore, the repeatability of liposome preparation is studied, 
      especially upon incorporation of PEGylated lipids in the bilayer. Finally, the 
      instruments applicability to monitor mechanical stress applied to vesicles is 
      demonstrated.

TI  - Detecting periodic limb movements with off-the-shelf accelerometers: a feasibility 
      study.
PG  - 152-6
AB  - Periodic limb movements are short movements of the legs that can lead to low sleep 
      quality in the general population. Currently, the gold standard to measure periodic 
      limb movements for diagnostic purposes is polysomnography. This is an expensive 
      technique that requires specially fitted laboratories and specialized personnel. In 
      this paper we explore the use of commercial, off-the-shelf accelerometers to detect 
      periodic limb movements during sleep and compare the results to the gold standard. 
      We recruited two subjects for one night and measured limb movements with 
      polysomnography and Actigraph GT3X accelerometers. We developed an open source Java 
      application for processing the data. A total of 846 events were recorded. We found a 
      very low similarity between polysomnography and GT3X data, indicating that our 
      accelerometer-based method is not yet feasible for medical diagnosis. Several 
      options for further development are: the exploration of different sensor locations, 
      sensors with higher sampling rates, as well as enhancement of data analysis methods.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Donating blood in Estonia is non-remunerated and voluntary. Estonian 
      Blood Service system has four independent regional blood centres that are 
      responsible for blood collection, processing, screening and distribution of blood 
      components to hospitals for clinical use. STUDY DESIGN: This research was carried 
      out as a questionnaire survey. A questionnaire was developed to study lapsing first 
      time donors' (FTD) blood donation experience, intention and willingness to donate 
      again. METHODS: A thousand five hundred and forty-six questionnaires were posted to 
      donors who had one successful donation in 2010 and who had not returned to second 
      donation till the year 2012. For data analysis routine statistical methods were 
      used. To evaluate the most appropriate number of classes, based on previous 
      experience and future expectations, latent class analysis was used. RESULTS: There 
      were 453 respondents (29.3%). For the majority of aspects of blood donation 
      experience the emotions were positive. Results of the study suggested that blood 
      collection agencies should intervene to bolster donors' attitudes, perceived 
      control, and identity as a donor during this crucial post-first donation period. 
      CONCLUSION: First blood donation seems to have been a positive experience. Reasons 
      leading to stopping blood donation should be studied further. Establishing a donor 
      registry for Estonia would be essential to keep track of donors.

LID - 10.1682/JRRD.2013.04.0091 [doi]
AB  - This study examines the effect of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) on function 
      and physical performance in older overweight military Veterans with comorbid 
      conditions. This is a secondary data analysis of older Veterans (mean age = 62.9 yr) 
      participating in a physical activity counseling trial. Study participants with PTSD 
      (n = 67) and without PTSD (n = 235) were identified. Self-reported physical function 
      (36-item Short Form Health Survey) and directly measured physical performance 
      (mobility, aerobic endurance, strength) were assessed. Multivariate analyses of 
      variance controlling for demographic factors and psychiatric disorders demonstrated 
      significant physical impairment among those with PTSD. PTSD was negatively 
      associated with self-reported physical function, functioning in daily activities, 
      and general health (p < 0.01). Those with PTSD also performed significantly worse on 
      tests of lower-limb function (p < 0.05). Despite being significantly younger, 
      Veterans with PTSD had comparable scores on gait speed, aerobic endurance, grip 
      strength, and bodily pain compared with Veterans without PTSD. This study provides 
      preliminary data for the negative association between PTSD and physical function in 
      older military Veterans. These data highlight the importance of ongoing monitoring 
      of physical performance among returning Veterans with PTSD and intervening in older 
      overweight Veterans with PTSD, whose physical performance scores are indicative of 
      accelerated risk of premature functional aging.

TI  - A Machine Learning Approach as a Surrogate for a Finite Element Analysis: Status of 
      Research and Application to One Dimensional Systems.
LID - 10.3390/s21051654 [doi]

AB  - Current maintenance intervals of mechanical systems are scheduled a priori based on 
      the life of the system, resulting in expensive maintenance scheduling, and often 
      undermining the safety of passengers. Going forward, the actual usage of a vehicle 
      will be used to predict stresses in its structure, and therefore, to define a 
      specific maintenance scheduling. Machine learning (ML) algorithms can be used to map 
      a reduced set of data coming from real-time measurements of a structure into a 
      detailed/high-fidelity finite element analysis (FEA) model of the same system. As a 
      result, the FEA-based ML approach will directly estimate the stress distribution 
      over the entire system during operations, thus improving the ability to define 
      ad-hoc, safe, and efficient maintenance procedures. The paper initially presents a 
      review of the current state-of-the-art of ML methods applied to finite elements. A 
      surrogate finite element approach based on ML algorithms is also proposed to 
      estimate the time-varying response of a one-dimensional beam. Several ML regression 
      models, such as decision trees and artificial neural networks, have been developed, 
      and their performance is compared for direct estimation of the stress distribution 
      over a beam structure. The surrogate finite element models based on ML algorithms 
      are able to estimate the response of the beam accurately, with artificial neural 
      networks providing more accurate results.

TI  - Popular epidemiology and "fracking": citizens' concerns regarding the economic, 
      environmental, health and social impacts of unconventional natural gas drilling 
      operations.
PG  - 534-41
LID - 10.1007/s10900-014-9968-x [doi]
AB  - Pennsylvania sits atop the Marcellus Shale, a reservoir of natural gas that was 
      untapped until the 2004 introduction of unconventional natural gas drilling 
      operations (UNGDO) in the state. Colloquially known as fracking, UNGDO is a 
      controversial process that employs large volumes of water to fracture the shale and 
      capture gas; it has become a multi-billion dollar industry in Pennsylvania. We 
      analyzed letters to the editor of the most widely circulated local newspaper in the 
      most heavily drilled county in Pennsylvania (Bradford County) in order to 
      characterize residents' concerns and their involvement in popular epidemiology--the 
      process by which citizens investigate risks associated with a perceived 
      environmental threat. We reviewed 215 letters to the editor that referenced natural 
      gas operations and were published by The Daily Review between January 1, 2008 and 
      June 8, 2013. We used NVivo 10 to code and analyze letters and identify major 
      themes. Nvivo is qualitative data analysis software 
      (http://www.qsrinternational.com/products_nvivo.aspx) that allows researchers to 
      code and analyze "unstructured" data, including text files of any type (e.g., 
      interview transcripts, news articles, letters, archival materials) as well as 
      photographs and videos. Nvivo can be used to classify, sort, query, comment on, and 
      share data across a research group. Letters demonstrated citizen engagement in 
      beginning and intermediate stages of lay epidemiology, as well as discord and stress 
      regarding four main issues: socio-economic impacts, perceived threats to water, 
      population growth and implications, and changes to the rural landscape. Residents 
      called for stronger scientific evidence and a balance of economic development and 
      health and environmental protections. Citizens' distress regarding UNGDO appeared to 
      be exacerbated by a dearth of information to guide economic growth and health, 
      environmental, and social concerns. This analysis proposes locally informed 
      questions to guide future surveillance and research.

TI  - Characterizing blood glucose variability using new metrics with continuous glucose 
      monitoring data.
PG  - 871-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Glycemic variability contributes to oxidative stress, which has been 
      linked to the pathogenesis of the long-term complications of diabetes. Currently, 
      the best metric for assessing glycemic variability is mean amplitude of glycemic 
      excursion (MAGE); however, MAGE is not in routine clinical use. A glycemic 
      variability metric in routine clinical use could potentially be an important measure 
      of overall glucose control and a predictor of diabetes complication risk not 
      detected by glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) levels. This study aimed to develop and 
      evaluate new automated metrics of glycemic variability that could be routinely 
      applied to continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data to assess and enhance glucose 
      control. METHOD: Individual 24 h CGM tracings from our clinical diabetes research 
      database were scored for MAGE and two additional metrics designed to compensate for 
      aspects of variability not captured by MAGE: (1) number of daily glucose 
      fluctuations >75 mg/dl that leave the normal range (70-175 mg/dl), or excursion 
      frequency, and (2) total daily fluctuation, or distance traveled. These scores were 
      used to train machine learning algorithms to recognize excessive variability based 
      on physician ratings of daily CGM charts, producing a third metric of glycemic 
      variability: perceived variability. Finger stick A1C (average) and serum 
      1,5-anhydroglucitol (postprandial) levels were used as clinical markers of overall 
      glucose control for comparison. RESULTS: Mean amplitude of glycemic excursion, 
      excursion frequency, and distance traveled did not adequately quantify the glycemic 
      variability visualized by physicians who evaluated the daily CGM plots. A naive 
      Bayes classifier was developed that characterizes CGM tracings based on physician 
      interpretations of tracings. Preliminary results suggest that the number of 
      excessively variable days, as determined by this naive Bayes classifier, may be an 
      effective way to automatically assess glycemic variability of CGM data. This metric 
      more closely reflects 90-day changes in serum 1,5-anhydroglucitol levels than does 
      MAGE. CONCLUSION: We have developed a new automated metric to assess overall 
      glycemic variability in people with diabetes using CGM, which could easily be 
      incorporated into commercially available CGM software. Additional work to validate 
      and refine this metric is underway. Future studies are planned to correlate the 
      metric with both urinary 8-iso-prostaglandin F2 alpha excretion and serum 
      1,5-anhydroglucitol levels to see how well it identifies patients with high glycemic 
      variability and increased markers of oxidative stress to assess risk for long-term 
      complications of diabetes.

TI  - The Difference between Anxiolytic and Anxiogenic Effects Induced by Acute and

AB  - We describe an interdisciplinary comparison of the effects of acute and chronic 
      alcohol exposure in terms of their disturbance of light, dark and color preferences 
      and the occurrence of Parkinson-like behavior in zebrafish through computer visual 
      tracking, data mining, and behavioral and physiological analyses. We found that 
      zebrafish in anxiolytic and anxious states, which are induced by acute and chronic 
      repeated alcohol exposure, respectively, display distinct emotional reactions in 
      light/dark preference tests as well as distinct learning and memory abilities in 
      color-enhanced conditional place preference (CPP) tests. Additionally, compared with 
      the chronic alcohol (1.0%) treatment, acute alcohol exposure had a significant, 
      dose-dependent effect on anxiety, learning and memory (color preference) as well as 
      locomotive activities. Acute exposure doses (0.5%, 1.0%, and 1.5%) generated an 
      "inverted V" dose-dependent pattern in all of the behavioral parameters, with 1.0% 
      having the greatest effect, while the chronic treatment had a moderate effect. 
      Furthermore, by measuring locomotive activity, learning and memory performance, the 
      number of dopaminergic neurons, tyrosine hydroxylase expression, and the change in 
      the photoreceptors in the retina, we found that acute and chronic alcohol exposure 
      induced varying degrees of Parkinson-like symptoms in zebrafish. Taken together, 
      these results illuminated the behavioral and physiological mechanisms underlying the 
      changes associated with learning and memory and the cause of potential 
      Parkinson-like behaviors in zebrafish due to acute and chronic alcohol exposure.

      reagent-free microscopy image analysis.
PG  - 539-46
LID - 10.1002/btpr.549 [doi]
AB  - A dedicated microscopy imaging system including automated positioning, focusing, 
      image acquisition, and image analysis was developed to characterize a yeast 
      population with regard to cell morphology. This method was used to monitor a 
      stress-model alcoholic fermentation with Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Combination of 
      dark field and epifluorescence microscopy after propidium iodide staining for 
      membrane integrity showed that cell death went along with important changes in cell 
      morphology, with a cell shrinking, the onset of inhomogeneities in the cytoplasm, 
      and a detachment of the plasma membrane from the cell wall. These modifications were 
      significant enough to enable a trained human operator to make the difference between 
      dead and viable cells. Accordingly, a multivariate data analysis using an artificial 
      neural network was achieved to build a predictive model to infer viability at 
      single-cell level automatically from microscopy images without any staining. 
      Applying this method to in situ microscope images could help to detect abnormal 
      situations during a fermentation course and to prevent cell death by applying 
      adapted corrective actions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To evaluate if the combination of several quantitative parameters into a 
      mathematical model would enhance the detection of myocardial ischemia during 
      dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) when compared to conventional wall motion 
      analysis. METHODS: In a prospective study design 151 patients (age 61.8 ± 9.2) in 
      test group and 105 patients (age 64.0 ± 10.6) in validation group were selected and 
      underwent DSE between January 2008 and December 2012. In all patients coronary 
      angiography was performed within 6-8 weeks from DSE, considering at least one 
      stenosis ≥50% per patient as significant coronary artery disease (CAD). Results of 
      DSE visual assessment and myocardial velocity, strain and strain rate parameters 
      derived from speckle tracking imaging were imported automatically to an originally 
      created software. A mathematical model calculating prognosis of at least one 
      stenosis per patient and stenosis in separate arteries was constructed. RESULTS: 
      Myocardial ischemia was visually detected in 60 (39.7 %) and in 58 (54.2 %) patients 
      of the test and validation group, respectively. A total of 76 (50.3 %) patients in 
      the test group and 69 patients (65.7 %) in the validation group had ≥50% coronary 
      stenosis. Sensitivity and specificity of the mathematical model per patient in the 
      test group were 91.6 % and 86.3 % compared to 76.8 % and 89.0 % of the visual 
      assessment, respectively. However, in the validation group the sensitivity, 
      specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value dropped down 
      significantly becoming lower to visual assessment. CONCLUSIONS: Myocardial 
      deformation imaging may potentially replace visual assessment with an automated 
      predictive model for stress-induced ischemia detection. However, a multiparametric 
      mathematical model based on quantitative deformation markers did not demonstrate 
      incremental value to visual assessment of wall motion.

      qualitative study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nearly 40% of parents with children aged 6 to 17 months consult a 
      healthcare professional when their child has a high temperature. Clinical guidelines 
      recommend temperature measurement in these children, but little is known about 
      parents' experiences of and beliefs about temperature measurement. This study aimed 
      to explore parents' concerns and beliefs about temperature measurement in children. 
      METHODS: Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted from May 2017 to June 
      2018 with 21 parents of children aged 4 months to 5.5 years, who were purposively 
      sampled from the METRIC study (a method comparison study comparing non-contact 
      infrared thermometers to axillary and tympanic thermometers in acutely ill 
      children). Data analysis followed a thematic approach. RESULTS: Parents described 
      the importance of being able to detect fever, in particular high fevers, and how 
      this then influenced their actions. The concept of "accuracy" was valued by parents 
      but the aspects of performance which were felt to reflect accuracy varied. Parents 
      used numerical values of temperature in four main ways: determining precision of the 
      thermometer on repeat measures, detecting a "bad" fever, as an indication to 
      administer antipyretics, or monitoring response to treatment. Family and social 
      networks, the internet, and medical professionals and resources, were all key 
      sources of advice for parents regarding fever, and guiding thermometer choice. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Temperature measurement in children has diagnostic value but can either 
      empower, or cause anxiety and practical challenges for parents. This represents an 
      opportunity for both improved communication between parents and healthcare 
      professionals, and technological development, to support parents to manage febrile 
      illness with greater confidence in the home.

AB  - Stress is a key indicator of wellness in human beings and a prime contributor to 
      performance degradation and errors during various human tasks. The overriding 
      purpose of this paper is to propose two algorithms (probabilistic and 
      non-probabilistic) that iteratively track stress states to compute a wellness index 
      in terms of the stress levels. This paper adopts the physiological view-point that 
      high stress is accompanied with large deviations in biometrics such as body 
      temperature, heart rate, etc., and the proposed algorithms iteratively track these 
      fluctuations to compute a personalized wellness index that is correlated to the 
      engagement levels of the tasks performed by the user. In essence, this paper 
      presents a quantitative relationship between temperature, occupational stress, and 
      wellness during different tasks. The simplicity of the statistical inference 
      algorithms make them favorable candidates for implementation on mobile platforms 
      such as smart phones in the future, thereby providing users an inexpensive 
      application for self-wellness monitoring for a healthier lifestyle.

TI  - Novel Analytic Methods Needed for Real-Time Continuous Core Body Temperature Data.
PG  - 95-111
LID - 10.1177/0193945916673058 [doi]
AB  - Affordable measurement of core body temperature (T(c)) in a continuous, real-time 
      fashion is now possible. With this advance comes a new data analysis paradigm for 
      occupational epidemiology. We characterize issues arising after obtaining T(c) data 
      over 188 workdays for 83 participating farmworkers, a population vulnerable to 
      effects of rising temperatures due to climate change. We describe a novel approach 
      to these data using smoothing and functional data analysis. This approach highlights 
      different data aspects compared with describing T(c) at a single time point or 
      summaries of the time course into an indicator function (e.g., did T(c) ever exceed 
      38 °C, the threshold limit value for occupational heat exposure). Participants 
      working in ferneries had significantly higher T(c) at some point during the workday 
      compared with those working in nurseries, despite a shorter workday for fernery 
      participants. Our results typify the challenges and opportunities in analyzing Big 
      Data streams from real-time physiologic monitoring.

AB  - Stress is a major growing concern in our day and age adversely impacting both 
      individuals and society. Stress research has a wide range of benefits from improving 
      personal operations, learning, and increasing work productivity to benefiting 
      society - making it an interesting and socially beneficial area of research. This 
      survey reviews sensors that have been used to measure stress and investigates 
      techniques for modelling stress. It discusses non-invasive and unobtrusive sensors 
      for measuring computed stress, a term we coin in the paper. Sensors that do not 
      impede everyday activities that could be used by those who would like to monitor 
      stress levels on a regular basis (e.g. vehicle drivers, patients with illnesses 
      linked to stress) is the focus of the discussion. Computational techniques have the 
      capacity to determine optimal sensor fusion and automate data analysis for stress 
      recognition and classification. Several computational techniques have been developed 
      to model stress based on techniques such as Bayesian networks, artificial neural 
      networks, and support vector machines, which this survey investigates. The survey 
      concludes with a summary and provides possible directions for further computational 
      stress research.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the cross-sectional association 
      between ambulatory 24-h blood pressure levels and cognitive performance while 
      considering the effects of potential confounders among community-dwelling adults 
      aged 65 years and older. METHODS: Based on a cross-sectional design, 1011 subjects 
      (mean age 66.2 +/- 0.8 years; 60.2% women) were recruited prospectively. Average 
      levels of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were 
      computed for a 24-h period. Cognitive performance was assessed by Folstein's 
      Mini-Mental State Examination, immediate and delay recall subtests of the French 
      version of the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test, and Trail Making Test A and 
      B. Age at baseline evaluation, gender, education level, anxiety, depression, 
      cardiovascular risk factors, antihypertensive drugs use, and body mass index were 
      used as confounders in data analysis. RESULTS: Multivariate logistic regression 
      showed that, compared with low DBP level (i.e., <80 mmHg) used as reference value, 
      only a high DBP level (i.e., >or=90 mmHg) was significantly associated with lower 
      performance in immediate recall (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.7 [1.3;5.9] for full 
      model, and adjusted OR = 2.6 [1.2;5.4] for the stepwise backward model). 
      Furthermore, the stepwise backward selection showed that male gender (adjusted OR = 
      2.2 [1.4;3.3]) and depression (adjusted OR = 2.4 [1.3;4.6]) were also significantly 
      associated with low performance in immediate recall, whereas a high education level 
      was associated with high performance (adjusted OR = 0.9 [0.8;0.9]). CONCLUSIONS: The 
      findings show that only high DBP was associated with lower episodic memory 
      performance compared with low DBP level in the studied sample. Further research is 
      needed to corroborate and explain this finding.

PG  - 37-44

AB  - The glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are a multifunctional family of phase II 
      enzymes that detoxify a variety of environmental chemicals, reactive intermediates, 
      and secondary products of oxidative damage. GST mRNA expression and catalytic 
      activity have been used as biomarkers of exposure to environmental chemicals. 
      However, factors such as species differences in induction, partial analyses of 
      multiple GST isoforms, and lack of understanding of fish GST gene regulation, have 
      confounded the use of GSTs as markers of pollutant exposure. In the present study, 
      we examined the effect of exposure to cadmium (Cd), a prototypical environmental 
      contaminant and inducer of mammalian GST, on GST mRNA expression in coho salmon 
      (Oncorhynchus kisutch) liver, gill, and olfactory tissues. GST expression data were 
      compared to those for metallothionein (MT), a prototypical biomarker of metal 
      exposure. Data mining of genomic databases led to the development of quantitative 
      real-time PCR (qPCR) assays for salmon GST isoforms encompassing 9 subfamilies, 
      including alpha, mu, pi, theta, omega, kappa, rho, zeta and microsomal GST. In vivo 
      acute (8-48 h) exposures to low (3.7 ppb) and high (347 ppb) levels of Cd relevant 
      to environmental scenarios elicited a variety of transient, albeit minor changes 
      (<2.5-fold) in tissue GST profiles, including some reductions in GST mRNA 
      expression. In general, olfactory GSTs were the earliest to respond to cadmium, 
      whereas, more pronounced effects in olfactory and gill GST expression were observed 
      at 48 h relative to earlier time points. Although evaluation of GSTs reflected a 
      cadmium-associated oxidative stress response, there was no clear GST isoform in any 
      tissue that could serve as a reliable biomarker of acute cadmium exposure. By 
      contrast, metallothionein (MT) mRNA was consistently and markedly induced in all 
      three tissues by cadmium, and among the tissues examined, olfactory MT was the most 
      sensitive marker of cadmium exposures. In summary, coho salmon exhibit a complex GST 
      tissue profile consisting of at least 9 isoforms, all of which are present in the 
      peripheral olfactory system. Short-term exposure to environmental levels of Cd 
      causes transient changes in salmon GST consistent with oxidative stress, and in some 
      cases, includes a loss of GST. In a biomarker context, however, monitoring of tissue 
      MT mRNA expression, especially in the peripheral olfactory system, may be of greater 
      utility for assessing short-term environmental exposures to cadmium.

TI  - Evicase: an evidence-based case structuring approach for personalized healthcare.
PG  - 604-8
AB  - The personalized medicine era stresses a growing need to combine evidence-based 
      medicine with case based reasoning in order to improve the care process. To address 
      this need we suggest a framework to generate multi-tiered statistical structures we 
      call Evicases. Evicase integrates established medical evidence together with patient 
      cases from the bedside. It then uses machine learning algorithms to produce 
      statistical results and aggregators, weighted predictions, and appropriate 
      recommendations. Designed as a stand-alone structure, Evicase can be used for a 
      range of decision support applications including guideline adherence monitoring and 
      personalized prognostic predictions.

AB  - Recombinant antibody fragments, for example, the classic monovalent single-chain 
      antibody (scFv), are emerging as credible alternatives to monoclonal antibody (mAb) 
      products. scFv fragments maintain a diverse range of potential applications in 
      biotechnology and can be implemented as powerful therapeutic and diagnostic agents. 
      As such, a variety of hosts have been used to produce antibody fragments resulting 
      in varying degrees of success. Yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is an attractive 
      host due to quality control mechanisms of the secretory pathway that ensure secreted 
      proteins are properly folded. However, the expression of a recombinant protein in 
      yeast is not trivial; neither are the quality control mechanisms the cell initiates 
      to respond to overwhelming stress, such as an increased protein load, simplistic. 
      The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a dynamic organelle, capable of sensing and 
      adjusting its folding capacity in response to increased demand. When protein 
      abundance or terminally misfolded proteins overwhelm the ER's capacity, the unfolded 
      protein response (UPR) is activated. In the guidelines presented here, we discuss 
      varying aspects of quality control, its modulation, and ways to design appropriate 
      constructs for yeast recombinant protein expression. Furthermore, we have provided 
      protocols and methods to monitor intracellular protein expression and trafficking as 
      well as evaluation of the UPR, with essential controls. The latter part of this 
      chapter will review considerations for the experimental design of microarray and 
      quantitative polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR) techniques while suggesting 
      appropriate means of data analysis.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: An increasing number of patients are voicing their opinions and 
      expectations about the quality of care in online forums and on physician rating 
      websites (PRWs). This paper analyzes patient online reviews (PORs) to identify 
      emerging and fading topics and sentiment trends in PRWs during the early stage of 
      the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: Text data were collected, including 55,612 PORs of 
      3430 doctors from three popular PRWs in the United States (RateMDs, HealthGrades, 
      and Vitals) from March 01 to June 27, 2020. An improved latent Dirichlet allocation 
      (LDA)-based topic modeling (topic coherence-based LDA [TCLDA]), manual annotation, 
      and sentiment analysis tool were applied to extract a suitable number of topics, 
      generate corresponding keywords, assign topic names, and determine trends in the 
      extracted topics and specific emotions. RESULTS: According to the coherence value 
      and manual annotation, the identified taxonomy includes 30 topics across high-rank 
      and low-rank disease categories. The emerging topics in PRWs focus mainly on themes 
      such as treatment experience, policy implementation regarding epidemic control 
      measures, individuals' attitudes toward the pandemic, and mental health across 
      high-rank diseases. In contrast, the treatment process and experience during 
      COVID-19, awareness and COVID-19 control measures, and COVID-19 deaths, fear, and 
      stress were the most popular themes for low-rank diseases. Panic buying and daily 
      life impact, treatment processes, and bedside manner were the fading themes across 
      high-rank diseases. In contrast, provider attitude toward patients during the 
      pandemic, detection at public transportation, passenger, travel bans and warnings, 
      and materials supplies and society support during COVID-19 were the most fading 
      themes across low-rank diseases. Regarding sentiment analysis, negative emotions 
      (fear, anger, and sadness) prevail during the early wave of the COVID-19. 
      CONCLUSION: Mining topic dynamics and sentiment trends in PRWs may provide valuable 
      knowledge of patients' opinions during the COVID-19 crisis. Policymakers should 
      consider these PORs and develop global healthcare policies and surveillance systems 
      through monitoring PRWs. The findings of this study identify research gaps in the 
      areas of e-health and text mining and offer future research directions.

LID - 10.1038/npp.2013.211 [doi]
AB  - Group functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies suggest that anxiety 
      disorders are associated with anomalous brain activation and functional connectivity 
      (FC). However, brain-based features sensitive enough to discriminate individual 
      subjects with a specific anxiety disorder and that track symptom severity 
      longitudinally, desirable qualities for putative disorder-specific biomarkers, 
      remain to be identified. Blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI during emotional 
      face perceptual tasks and a new, large-scale and condition-dependent FC and machine 
      learning approach were used to identify features (pair-wise correlations) that 
      discriminated patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD, N=16) from controls 
      (N=19). We assessed whether these features discriminated SAD from panic disorder 
      (PD, N=16), and SAD from controls in an independent replication sample that 
      performed a similar task at baseline (N: SAD=15, controls=17) and following 8-weeks 
      paroxetine treatment (N: SAD=12, untreated controls=7). High SAD vs HCs 
      discrimination (area under the ROC curve, AUC, arithmetic mean of sensitivity and 
      specificity) was achieved with two FC features during unattended neutral face 
      perception (AUC=0.88, P<0.05 corrected). These features also discriminated SAD vs PD 
      (AUC=0.82, P=0.0001) and SAD vs HCs in the independent replication sample (FC during 
      unattended angry face perception, AUC=0.71, P=0.01). The most informative FC was 
      left hippocampus-left temporal pole, which was reduced in both SAD samples 
      (replication sample P=0.027), and this FC increased following the treatment 
      (post>pre, t(11)=2.9, P=0.007). In conclusion, SAD is associated with reduced FC 
      between left temporal pole and left hippocampus during face perception, and results 
      suggest promise for emerging FC-based biomarkers for SAD diagnosis and treatment 
      effects.

TI  - ASAS-NANP SYMPOSIUM: Applications of machine learning for livestock body weight 
      prediction from digital images.
LID - 10.1093/jas/skab022 [doi]
LID - skab022
AB  - Monitoring, recording, and predicting livestock body weight (BW) allows for timely 
      intervention in diets and health, greater efficiency in genetic selection, and 
      identification of optimal times to market animals because animals that have already 
      reached the point of slaughter represent a burden for the feedlot. There are 
      currently two main approaches (direct and indirect) to measure the BW in livestock. 
      Direct approaches include partial-weight or full-weight industrial scales placed in 
      designated locations on large farms that measure passively or dynamically the weight 
      of livestock. While these devices are very accurate, their acquisition, intended 
      purpose and operation size, repeated calibration and maintenance costs associated 
      with their placement in high-temperature variability, and corrosive environments are 
      significant and beyond the affordability and sustainability limits of small and 
      medium size farms and even of commercial operators. As a more affordable alternative 
      to direct weighing approaches, indirect approaches have been developed based on 
      observed or inferred relationships between biometric and morphometric measurements 
      of livestock and their BW. Initial indirect approaches involved manual measurements 
      of animals using measuring tapes and tubes and the use of regression equations able 
      to correlate such measurements with BW. While such approaches have good BW 
      prediction accuracies, they are time consuming, require trained and skilled farm 
      laborers, and can be stressful for both animals and handlers especially when 
      repeated daily. With the concomitant advancement of contactless electro-optical 
      sensors (e.g., 2D, 3D, infrared cameras), computer vision (CV) technologies, and 
      artificial intelligence fields such as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), 
      2D and 3D images have started to be used as biometric and morphometric proxies for 
      BW estimations. This manuscript provides a review of CV-based and ML/DL-based BW 
      prediction methods and discusses their strengths, weaknesses, and industry 
      applicability potential.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the associations between post-game recovery protocols and 
      physical and perceptual recovery, and game performance in Australian Football League 
      players. DESIGN: A longitudinal quasi-experimental study design was used across a 
      season. METHODS: A full squad of 44 footballers was monitored weekly across a 
      23-game season. Players were required to choose from a number of recovery modalities 
      available immediately post-game. These included floor stretching, pool stretching, 
      bike active recovery, pool active recovery, cold-water immersion, contrast therapy 
      and use of a compression garment. Perceptual measures of recovery were recorded 
      throughout the week and a test of physical performance was conducted two days 
      post-game. Game performance ratings were also recorded. The associations between the 
      post-game recovery protocols chosen and players' perceived recovery, and physical 
      and game performances were determined by the association rule data-mining strategy. 
      RESULTS: Statistically significant associations were found between a number of 
      post-game recovery protocols and perceptual recovery. In general, players who chose 
      cold-water immersion, floor stretching, no active recovery (neither bike or pool) 
      and the use of a compression garment post-game, had an increased probability of 
      reporting greater perceptual recovery across the following week, relative to all 
      other permutations of recovery protocols chosen. There were no associations found 
      between post-game recovery protocol combinations and physical recovery. No 
      associations were found between the post-game recovery methods and the next game 
      performance. CONCLUSIONS: Perceptual recovery among players was enhanced through the 
      selection of specific combinations of recovery protocols post game. However, no 
      links were found between recovery protocols and physical or game performance 
      measures.

TI  - A Mobile Device App to Reduce Medication Errors and Time to Drug Delivery During 
      Pediatric Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation: Study Protocol of a Multicenter Randomized 
      Controlled Crossover Trial.
PG  - e167
LID - 10.2196/resprot.7901 [doi]
LID - e167
AB  - BACKGROUND: During pediatric cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), vasoactive drug 
      preparation for continuous infusions is complex and time-consuming. The need for 
      individual specific weight-based drug dose calculation and preparation places 
      children at higher risk than adults for medication errors. Following an 
      evidence-based and ergonomic driven approach, we developed a mobile device app 
      called Pediatric Accurate Medication in Emergency Situations (PedAMINES), intended 
      to guide caregivers step-by-step from preparation to delivery of drugs requiring 
      continuous infusion. In a prior single center randomized controlled trial, 
      medication errors were reduced from 70% to 0% by using PedAMINES when compared with 
      conventional preparation methods. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to 
      determine whether the use of PedAMINES in both university and smaller hospitals 
      reduces medication dosage errors (primary outcome), time to drug preparation (TDP), 
      and time to drug delivery (TDD) (secondary outcomes) during pediatric CPR when 
      compared with conventional preparation methods. METHODS: This is a multicenter, 
      prospective, randomized controlled crossover trial with 2 parallel groups comparing 
      PedAMINES with a conventional and internationally used drug infusion rate table in 
      the preparation of continuous drug infusion. The evaluation setting uses a 
      simulation-based pediatric CPR cardiac arrest scenario with a high-fidelity manikin. 
      The study involving 120 certified nurses (sample size) will take place in the 
      resuscitation rooms of 3 tertiary pediatric emergency departments and 3 smaller 
      hospitals. After epinephrine-induced return of spontaneous circulation, nurses will 
      be asked to prepare a continuous infusion of dopamine using either PedAMINES 
      (intervention group) or the infusion table (control group) and then prepare a 
      continuous infusion of norepinephrine by crossing the procedure. The primary outcome 
      is the medication dosage error rate. The secondary outcome is the time in seconds 
      elapsed since the oral prescription by the physician to drug delivery by the nurse 
      in each allocation group. TDD includes TDP. Stress level during the resuscitation 
      scenario will be assessed for each participant by questionnaire and recorded by the 
      heart rate monitor of a fitness watch. The study is formatted according to the 
      Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials Statement for Randomized Controlled 
      Trials of Electronic and Mobile Health Applications and Online TeleHealth 
      (CONSORT-EHEALTH) and the Reporting Guidelines for Health Care Simulation Research. 
      RESULTS: Enrollment and data analysis started in March 2017. We anticipate the 
      intervention will be completed in late 2017, and study results will be submitted in 
      early 2018 for publication expected in mid-2018. Results will be reported in line 
      with recommendations from CONSORT-EHEALTH and the Reporting Guidelines for Health 
      Care Simulation Research . CONCLUSIONS: This paper describes the protocol used for a 
      clinical trial assessing the impact of a mobile device app to reduce the rate of 
      medication errors, time to drug preparation, and time to drug delivery during 
      pediatric resuscitation. As research in this area is scarce, results generated from 
      this study will be of great importance and might be sufficient to change and improve 
      the pediatric emergency care practice. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov

TI  - Antioxidant responses in the earthworm Aporrectodea caliginosa of eastern Slovakia: 
      application of principal component analysis as a tool to identify metal contaminated 
      areas.
PG  - 21

AB  - The soil of Slovak Republic is severely contaminated with heavy metals, creating 
      hazards to soil health. In order to assess the current status with the prospect of 
      selecting the appropriate treatment methods and land use, this investigation aimed 
      to determine a panel of complementary and ecologically relevant biomarkers that 
      reflect adverse biological responses towards terrestrial pollutants. To attain this 
      objective, the concentration of reduced glutathione and enzymes of glutathione 
      antioxidant system were assessed in clitellate earthworm, Aporrectodea caliginosa 
      sampled from selected sites of eastern Slovakia along with the pH and total metal 
      concentration (As, Cd, Pb, Cr, Hg, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) of soils. Positive, 
      significant (p < 0.05) induction of glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, 
      and glutathione-S-transferase activities and depletion of reduced glutathione level 
      (negative correlation) were associated with the increased soil metal concentrations. 
      Metal interference was found in the detoxification process and antioxidant defense 
      mechanism does not efficiently counteract the oxidative stress induced by chronic 
      metal exposure. The tested biomarkers confirmed sensitive and affective response to 
      the pollution of soil contaminants, in this case metals. This has a potential use in 
      ecotoxicological field monitoring. The proposed principal component analysis is a 
      multivariate model of data analysis that represents a cost-effective approach to 
      differentiate metalliferous soils of eastern Slovakia with different health status.

      biomolecule aggregates: Application to stressed monoclonal antibody study.

AB  - This study aimed to explore the suitability of flow injection spectrophotometry 
      (FIS) to analyze three degraded therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (bevacizumab, 
      nivolumab, and rituximab). For this purpose, aggregates were generated with 
      stirring, freeze-thaw, and heat stresses. The intact and stressed mab samples were 
      filtered with 0.22 µm hydrophilic filters and analyzed by size exclusion 
      chromatography (SEC), cation-exchange chromatography (CEX), and FIS. In terms of 
      quantitative and qualitative analysis, protein loss and structural changes were 
      assessed. Various aggregates profiles were obtained according to the mabs and the 
      stresses. FIS allowed performing very satisfactory quantifications for each mab with 
      intermediate precision RSD < 3.0 % and recovery between 97.9 and 102.0 %. From the 
      protein loss measurements, it appears that SEC underestimates the mab aggregate 
      proportions up to two times less as compared with FIS since the latter avoids any 
      non-specific interactions (electrostatic or hydrophobic interactions). Using second 
      derivative spectroscopy and multivariate data analysis, we noticed apparent 
      structural differences, located in the regions 245-265 nm for rituximab and 
      nivolumab and 280-300 nm for bevacizumab, depending on the stress. The FIS 
      complementarity with the other techniques used in this study allowed us to 
      demonstrate that the three mabs behave differently for a given stress condition. 
      While extreme mechanical stress formed large aggregates irrespective of the mabs, 
      rituximab showed to be less stable and more sensitive than the two other mabs under 
      freeze-thaw and heat stresses, generating large aggregates (>200 nm) and partial 
      unfolding. Nivolumab tends to form small aggregates less than 50 nm when heated and 
      freeze-thawed. Moreover, freeze-thaw seems to generate native IgG-1 aggregates with 
      rituximab. Similarly, bevacizumab showed to form these IgG-1 aggregates and was 
      resistant to freeze-thaw, likely thanks to trehalose cryoprotectant from its 
      formulation. Finally, FIS associated with multivariate analysis can provide rich 
      information in one single run and appears to be a fast, simple, and reliable method 
      to set complementary and orthogonal approaches for protein aggregates monitoring.

TI  - Epidemiological surveillance linked to an outreach psychological support program 
      after the Xynthia storm in Charente-Maritime, France, 2010.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Following the Xynthia storm of February 2010 in France, an outreach 
      program was initiated by the regional health authorities during the post-emergency 
      phase to improve access to mental health care for the population exposed to the 
      floods. The program was designed to complement routine health and social care 
      services. It relied on a special telephone service and outreach consultations 
      located in the town halls of the five most affected cities. The objective of this 
      outreach service was to provide initial psychological counseling free of charge and 
      without appointment. Another objective was to refer persons for appropriate 
      treatment and follow-up by routine health care services. A surveillance program was 
      developed to monitor the use of mental health services by first-time users, describe 
      outreach service users with psychological manifestations, and provide timely 
      information to decision makers. METHODS: Health providers working in affected towns 
      were asked to complete an individual record sheet for each person who displayed 
      psychological manifestations directly or indirectly linked with the storm on their 
      first visit, and to send it to the regional health office. Participation was 
      voluntary. Data analysis was performed monthly during the six-month surveillance 
      period. RESULTS: Only mental health providers participated in the surveillance. A 
      total of 227 individual files were sent from April 7 through September 19, 2010. New 
      cases were mainly female adults, and one fifth had a past history of psychiatric 
      illness. Depressive signs and anxiety were the most commonly reported symptoms, 
      followed by signs of post-traumatic stress disorder. A total of five feedback 
      reports were produced for surveillance participants (informants) and authorities. 
      CONCLUSION: With initiation in the post-emergency phase of a disaster and timely 
      regular feedback, the surveillance program enabled the authors to describe the 
      occurrence of psychological distress, monitor mental health service use by 
      first-time users, and provide guidance to health authorities. This research showed 
      the advantages of integrating epidemiology in the development of strategy for mental 
      health and psychosocial support in the aftermath of natural catastrophes.

      Validation of an Approach Utilizing a Larval Zebrafish Locomotor Assay.

AB  - Gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptors are major inhibitory 
      neurotransmitter receptors in the central nervous system and a target for numerous 
      clinically important drugs used to treat anxiety, insomnia, and epilepsy. A series 
      of allosteric GABA(A) receptor agonists was identified previously with the aid of 
      HPLC-based activity profiling, whereby activity was tracked with an 
      electrophysiological assay in Xenopus laevis oocytes. To accelerate the discovery 
      process, an approach has been established for HPLC-based profiling using a larval 
      zebrafish (Danio rerio) seizure model induced by pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), a 
      pro-convulsant GABA(A) receptor antagonist. The assay was validated with the aid of 
      representative GABAergic plant compounds and extracts. Various parameters that are 
      relevant for the quality of results obtained, including PTZ concentration, the 
      number of larvae, the incubation time, and the data analysis protocol, were 
      optimized. The assay was then translated into an HPLC profiling protocol, and active 
      compounds were tracked in extracts of Valeriana officinalis and Magnolia 
      officinalis. For selected compounds the effects in the zebrafish larvae model were 
      compared with data from in silico blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability 
      predictions, to validate the use for discovery of BBB-permeable natural products.

TI  - Interrogating cAMP-dependent kinase signaling in Jurkat T cells via a protein kinase 
      A targeted immune-precipitation phosphoproteomics approach.
PG  - 3350-9
LID - 10.1074/mcp.O113.028456 [doi]
AB  - In the past decade, mass-spectrometry-based methods have emerged for the 
      quantitative profiling of dynamic changes in protein phosphorylation, allowing the 
      behavior of thousands of phosphorylation sites to be monitored in a single 
      experiment. However, when one is interested in specific signaling pathways, such 
      shotgun methodologies are not ideal because they lack selectivity and are not cost 
      and time efficient with respect to instrument and data analysis time. Here we 
      evaluate and explore a peptide-centric antibody generated to selectively enrich 
      peptides containing the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) consensus motif. This 
      targeted phosphoproteomic strategy is used to profile temporal quantitative changes 
      of potential PKA substrates in Jurkat T lymphocytes upon prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) 
      stimulation, which increases intracellular cAMP, activating PKA. Our method combines 
      ultra-high-specificity motif-based immunoaffinity purification with cost-efficient 
      stable isotope dimethyl labeling. We identified 655 phosphopeptides, of which 642 
      (i.e. 98%) contained the consensus motif [R/K][R/K/X]X[pS/pT]. When our data were 
      compared with a large-scale Jurkat T-lymphocyte phosphoproteomics dataset containing 
      more than 10,500 phosphosites, a minimal overlap of 0.2% was observed. This stresses 
      the need for such targeted analyses when the interest is in a particular kinase. Our 
      data provide a resource of likely substrates of PKA, and potentially some substrates 
      of closely related kinases. Network analysis revealed that about half of the 
      observed substrates have been implicated in cAMP-induced signaling. Still, the other 
      half of the here-identified substrates have been less well characterized, 
      representing a valuable resource for future research.

TI  - A Novel Method for Estimating Myocardial Strain: Assessment of Deformation Tracking 
      Against Reference Magnetic Resonance Methods in Healthy Volunteers.
PG  - 38774

AB  - We developed a novel method for tracking myocardial deformation using cardiac 
      magnetic resonance (CMR) cine imaging. We hypothesised that circumferential strain 
      using deformation-tracking has comparable diagnostic performance to a validated 
      method (Displacement Encoding with Stimulated Echoes- DENSE) and potentially 
      diagnostically superior to an established cine-strain method (feature-tracking). 81 
      healthy adults (44.6 ± 17.7 years old, 47% male), without any history of 
      cardiovascular disease, underwent CMR at 1.5 T including cine, DENSE, and late 
      gadolinium enhancement in subjects >45 years. Acquisitions were divided into 6 
      segments, and global and segmental peak circumferential strain were derived and 
      analysed by age and sex. Peak circumferential strain differed between the 3 groups 
      (DENSE: -19.4 ± 4.8%; deformation-tracking: -16.8 ± 2.4%; feature-tracking: 
      -28.7 ± 4.8%) (ANOVA with Tukey post-hoc, F-value 279.93, p < 0.01). DENSE and 
      deformation-tracking had better reproducibility than feature-tracking. Intra-class 
      correlation co-efficient was >0.90. Larger magnitudes of strain were detected in 
      women using deformation-tracking and DENSE, but not feature-tracking. Compared with 
      a reference method (DENSE), deformation-tracking using cine imaging has similar 
      diagnostic performance for circumferential strain assessment in healthy individuals. 
      Deformation-tracking could potentially obviate the need for bespoke strain 
      sequences, reducing scanning time and is more reproducible than feature-tracking.

TI  - Health economic evaluations comparing insulin glargine with NPH insulin in patients 
      with type 1 diabetes: a systematic review.
PG  - 15
LID - 10.1186/1478-7547-9-15 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Compared to conventional human basal insulin (neutral protamine 
      Hagedorn; NPH) the long-acting analogue insulin glargine (GLA) is associated with a 
      number of advantages regarding metabolic control, hypoglycaemic events and 
      convenience. However, the unit costs of GLA exceed those of NPH. This study aims to 
      systematically review the economic evidence comparing GLA with NPH in basal-bolus 
      treatment (intensified conventional therapy; ICT) of type 1 diabetes in order to 
      facilitate informed decision making in clinical practice and health policy. METHODS: 
      A systematic literature search was performed for the period of January 1st 2000 to 
      December 1st 2009 via Embase, Medline, the Cochrane Library, the databases GMS 
      (German Medical Science) and DAHTA (Deutsche Agentur für Health Technology 
      Assessment), and the abstract books of relevant international scientific congresses. 
      Retrieved studies were reviewed based on predefined inclusion criteria, 
      methodological and quality aspects. In order to allow comparison between studies, 
      currencies were converted using purchasing power parities (PPP). RESULTS: A total of 
      7 health economic evaluations from 4 different countries fulfilled the predefined 
      criteria: 6 modelling studies, all of them cost-utility analyses, and one claims 
      data analysis with a cost-minimisation design. One cost-utility analysis showed 
      dominance of GLA over NPH. The other 5 cost-utility analyses resulted in additional 
      costs per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained for GLA, ranging from € 3,859 to 
      € 57,002 (incremental cost effectiveness ratio; ICER). The cost-minimisation 
      analysis revealed lower annual diabetes-specific costs in favour of NPH from the 
      perspective of the German Statutory Health Insurance (SHI). CONCLUSIONS: The 
      incremental cost-utility-ratios (ICER) show favourable values for GLA with 
      considerable variation. If a willingness-to-pay threshold of £ 30,000 (National 
      Institute of Clinical Excellence, UK) is adopted, GLA is cost-effective in 4 of 6 
      cost utility analyses (CUA) included. Thus insulin glargine (GLA) seems to offer 
      good value for money. Comparability between studies is limited because of 
      methodological and country specific aspects. The results of this review underline 
      that evaluation of insulin therapy should use evidence on efficacy of therapy from 
      information synthesis. The concept of relating utility decrements to fear of 
      hypoglycaemia is a plausible approach but needs further investigation. Also future 
      evaluations of basal-bolus insulin therapy should include costs of consumables such 
      as needles for insulin injection as well as test strips and lancets for blood 
      glucose self monitoring.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In a contemporary multicultural context that stimulates new dynamics 
      within the plural health systems, the universality of the patient autonomy principle 
      is questioned. Wishing to contribute to the discussion on the topic, this article 
      presents a reflection drawn from a case study in an integrative health care (IHC) 
      clinic. This type of organization, polarizing a variety of care traditions, is an 
      exceptional social laboratory for the analysis of the convergence of values and 
      ethical principles, marked by various cultural foundations. METHODOLOGY: The 
      combination of different data collection methods (semi-structured interviews, 
      participant observation during interprofessional meetings, recorded clinical 
      meetings) permitted the detailed analysis of patients' therapeutic itineraries in a 
      Quebec IHC clinic that grouped practitioners of biomedical, alternative and 
      traditional approaches. The interpretive conceptual framework illustrates the 
      occasionally contradictory intersection of different cultural foundations 
      influencing patient and practitioner explanatory models (EM) and semantic networks 
      (SN). RESULTS: Data analysis highlights a dissonance between a liberal and Cartesian 
      conception of the individual, responsible for the management of his or her health, 
      and some Taoist premises of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), prioritizing the 
      benefit of the person to his or her self-determination. The monitoring of 
      therapeutic patient itineraries emphasized a phenomenon of EM plurivocality, 
      proposing that individuals can use different voices and embody different characters, 
      autonomous or heteronomous, depending on the context in which they describe their 
      illness. The exploration of the heterogeneity of patients' SNs illustrates that it 
      is possible for the same person to both need to be taken by the hand and desire 
      autonomy. CONCLUSION: Stressing the influence of certain cultural foundations on 
      differential prioritization of patient autonomy principle, this article offers a 
      reflection on the development of narrative ethnomedical ethics respecting the 
      idiosyncrasies and plurivocality of the person.

TI  - Evaluation of salivary VOC profile composition directed towards oral cancer and oral 
      lesion assessment.
LID - 10.1007/s00784-020-03754-y [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Endogenous substances have been analyzed in biological samples in order 
      to be related with metabolic dysfunctions and diseases. The study aimed to 
      investigate profiles of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from fresh and incubated 
      saliva donated by healthy controls, individuals with oral tissue lesions and with 
      oral cancer, in order to assess case-specific biomarkers of oxidative stress. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: VOCs were pre-concentrated using headspace-solid phase 
      microextraction and analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Then, VOCs 
      positively modulated by incubation process were subtracted, yielding profiles with 
      selected features. Principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis 
      were used to inspect data distribution, while univariate statistics was applied to 
      indicate potential markers of oral cancer. Machine learning algorithm was 
      implemented, aiming multiclass prediction. RESULTS: The removal of bacterial 
      contribution to VOC profiles allowed the obtaining of more specific case-related 
      patterns. Artificial neural network model included 9 most relevant compounds 
      (1-octen-3-ol, hexanoic acid, E-2-octenal, heptanoic acid, octanoic acid, 
      E-2-nonenal, nonanoic acid, 2,4-decadienal and 9-undecenoic acid). Model performance 
      was assessed using 10-fold cross validation and receiver operating characteristic 
      curves. Obtained overall accuracy was 90%. Oral cancer cases were predicted with 
      100% of sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSIONS: The selected VOCs were ascribed to 
      lipid oxidation mechanism and presented potential to differentiate oral cancer from 
      other inflammatory conditions. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: These results highlight the 
      importance of interpretation of saliva composition and the clinical value of 
      salivary VOCs. Elucidated metabolic alterations have the potential to aid the early 
      detection of oral cancer and the monitoring of oral lesions.

TI  - Use of personal EEG monitors in a behavioral neuroscience course to investigate 
      natural setting sleep patterns and the factors affecting them in college students.
PG  - A65-70
AB  - Sleep is often a topic of avid interest to college students, yet it is one that does 
      not yield itself well to hands-on, interactive learning modules. Supplementing 
      classroom learning with interactive "real world" laboratory activities provides 
      students with a deeper understanding of behavior and its neural control. The project 
      described here was designed to supplement the teaching of EEGs, sleep and circadian 
      rhythms and involved students in the empirical process from hypothesizing about the 
      factors that affect sleep, to personal data collection, data analysis and writing in 
      the style of a peer-reviewed manuscript. Students enrolled in Behavioral 
      Neuroscience at Connecticut College were provided with a home-based personal EEG 
      monitor used to collect sleep data in their natural sleep setting. Participants 
      recorded sleep data with the use of the ZEO® Personal Sleep Coach system and 
      completed a nightly sleep journal questionnaire for seven nights. The ZEO® system 
      uses EEG patterns to define sleep stages including wakefulness, light, deep and REM 
      sleep. The journal included questions about factors known to affect sleep such as 
      stress, caffeine, academic activity, exercise and alcohol. A class data set was 
      compiled and used by students to perform univariate correlations examining the 
      relationships between ZEO® variables and sleep journal variables. The data set 
      allowed students to choose specific variables to investigate, analyze and write a 
      peer-reviewed style manuscript. Significant class-wide correlations were found 
      between specific sleep stages and behavioral variables suggesting that the ZEO® 
      system is sophisticated yet inexpensive enough to be used as an effective tool in 
      the classroom setting. Overall student feedback on the exercise was positive with 
      many students indicating that it significantly enhanced their understanding of sleep 
      architecture and made them keenly aware of the factors that affect quality of sleep.

TI  - Eligibility criteria and psychological profiles in patient candidates for awake 
      craniotomy: a pilot study.
PG  - 209-16
LID - 10.1097/ANA.0b013e3182464aec [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although generally well tolerated, awake craniotomy is burdened by 
      non-negligible failure rates. The aim of this pilot study was to verify the 
      feasibility of a wider research scope to define objective criteria for patient 
      exclusion and the risk of intraoperative mapping failures. METHODS: Twenty-one 
      patients with brain tumors were subjected to a procedure in 3 steps: 
      neuropsychological criteria for both cognition and language; psychological 
      questionnaires for anxiety, attitude to pain and depression, and psychophysiological 
      monitoring for the candidate's capacity for self-control; and an intraoperative 
      interview for the patient's perception during awake procedure. Outcome measures were 
      as follows: (1) patient compliance, defined as patient response to the 
      intraoperative procedure and measured by psychological scale scores for fear and 
      pain, and (2) failure, defined as the impossibility to complete brain mapping 
      (minor) or conversion to general anesthesia (major). Data analysis included the 
      description of preoperative and intraoperative assessments and their evaluation 
      (Spearman ρ test), and the prognostic factors for intraoperative compliance and 
      procedure failure (Mann-Whitney test). RESULTS: Three patients were considered 
      ineligible after the first step. In the remaining 18, the responses of 10 patients 
      fell within the normal range and 8 showed some degree of impairment on at least 1 
      preoperative evaluation, but not enough to be excluded from awake surgery. The data 
      analysis also showed that fear of pain correlated with pain felt during the 
      operation and preoperatively with depression and psychophysiological changes, the 
      latter of which was associated with fear felt during craniotomy. Minor failures 
      occurred in 2 patients. CONCLUSIONS: From these preliminary results, we observed 
      that warning signs for minor failure were fear of pain and anxiety, as revealed by 
      psychological questionnaire responses, and the incapability of self-control at 
      psychophysiological monitoring. This assessment may serve to fit mapping modality to 
      the single patient and to avoid complications.

TI  - A pathway underlying the impact of CPAP adherence on intimate relationship with bed 
      partner in men with obstructive sleep apnea.
PG  - 543-51
LID - 10.1007/s11325-015-1235-6 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Our aim was to determine the pathway underlying the effects of continuous 
      positive airway pressure (CPAP) adherence on intimate relationship with bed partner 
      in men with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). We hypothesized that CPAP with good 
      adherence affected the intimate relationship with bed partner directly and 
      indirectly, and it was mediated through daytime sleepiness and activity level in men 
      with OSA. METHODS: Data were obtained from an education program for enhancing CPAP 
      adherence. Men who were newly diagnosed of OSA and CPAP therapy naïve were recruited 
      in a tertiary teaching hospital. RESULTS: Self-reported quality of life [Functional 
      Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire], daytime sleepiness [Epworth Sleepiness Scale 
      (ESS)], and negative emotion symptoms [depression, anxiety, stress scale] were 
      assessed before and after CPAP treatment at 1-year assessment. Seventy-three men 
      were included in the data analysis, with a mean ± SD age of 52 ± 10 years, body mass 
      index of 29.0 ± 5.2 kg/m(2), ESS of 9.5 ± 5.6, and median [interquartile range(IR)] 
      apnea and hypopnea index of 31 (21, 56) events/h. The median (IR) CPAP daily usage 
      was 4.3(0, 6.1) h/day. From the path analysis, CPAP therapy was shown to improve 
      intimate relationship directly (ß = 0.185) and indirectly (ß = 0.050) by reducing 
      daytime sleepiness and increasing activity level. However, negative emotion symptoms 
      were not the mediators between CPAP adherence and the intimate relationship. 
      CONCLUSIONS: CPAP therapy with good adherence is related directly and indirectly to 
      a better intimate relationship with bed partner in men with OSA. It was possibly 
      attributed to reduced daytime sleepiness and increased activity level.

TI  - Technician-Scored Stool Consistency Spans the Full Range of the Bristol Scale in a 
      Healthy US Population and Differs by Diet and Chronic Stress Load.
LID - nxab019 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/jn/nxab019 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prior studies of adults with constipation or diarrhea suggest that 
      dietary intake, physical activity, and stress may affect stool consistency. However, 
      the influence of these factors is unresolved and has not been investigated in 
      healthy adults. OBJECTIVES: We assessed the relations of technician-scored stool 
      consistency in healthy adults with self-reported diet, objectively monitored 
      physical activity, and quantifiable markers of stress. METHODS: Stool consistency 
      was scored by an independent technician using the Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS) to 
      analyze samples provided by healthy adults, aged 18-65 y, BMI 18-44 kg/m2, in the 
      USDA Nutritional Phenotyping Study (n = 364). A subset of participants (n = 109) 
      were also asked to rate their sample using the BSFS. Dietary intake was assessed 
      with two to three 24-h recalls completed at home and energy expenditure from 
      physical activity was monitored using an accelerometer in the 7-d period preceding 
      the stool collection. Stress was measured using the Wheaton Chronic Stress Inventory 
      and allostatic load (AL). Statistical and machine learning analyses were conducted 
      to determine which dietary, physiological, lifestyle, and stress factors differed by 
      stool form. RESULTS: Technician-scored BSFS scores were significantly further 
      (P = 0.003) from the central score (mean ± SEM distance: 1.41 ± 0.089) than the 
      self-reported score (1.06 ± 0.086). Hard stool was associated with higher 
      (P = 0.005) intake of saturated fat (13.8 ± 0.40 g/1000 kcal) than was normal stool 
      (12.5 ± 0.30 g/1000 kcal). AL scores were lower for normal stool (2.49 ± 0.15) than 
      for hard (3.07 ± 0.18) (P = 0.009) or soft stool (2.89 ± 0.18) (P = 0.049). Machine 
      learning analyses revealed that various dietary components, physiological 
      characteristics, and stress hormones predicted stool consistency. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Technician-scored stool consistency differed by dietary intake and stress hormones, 
      but not by physical activity, in healthy adults.This trial was registered at 
      clincialtrials.gov as NCT02367287.

AB  - COVID-19 has infected 77.4 million people worldwide and has caused 1.7 million 
      fatalities as of December 21, 2020. The primary cause of death due to COVID-19 is 
      Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). According to the World Health 
      Organization (WHO), people who are at least 60 years old or have comorbidities that 
      have primarily been targeted are at the highest risk from SARS-CoV-2. Medical 
      imaging provides a non-invasive, touch-free, and relatively safer alternative tool 
      for diagnosis during the current ongoing pandemic. Artificial intelligence (AI) 
      scientists are developing several intelligent computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools 
      in multiple imaging modalities, i.e., lung computed tomography (CT), chest X-rays, 
      and lung ultrasounds. These AI tools assist the pulmonary and critical care 
      clinicians through (a) faster detection of the presence of a virus, (b) classifying 
      pneumonia types, and (c) measuring the severity of viral damage in COVID-19-infected 
      patients. Thus, it is of the utmost importance to fully understand the requirements 
      of for a fast and successful, and timely lung scans analysis. This narrative review 
      first presents the pathological layout of the lungs in the COVID-19 scenario, 
      followed by understanding and then explains the comorbid statistical distributions 
      in the ARDS framework. The novelty of this review is the approach to classifying the 
      AI models as per the by school of thought (SoTs), exhibiting based on segregation of 
      techniques and their characteristics. The study also discusses the identification of 
      AI models and its extension from non-ARDS lungs (pre-COVID-19) to ARDS lungs 
      (post-COVID-19). Furthermore, it also presents AI workflow considerations of for 
      medical imaging modalities in the COVID-19 framework. Finally, clinical AI design 
      considerations will be discussed. We conclude that the design of the current 
      existing AI models can be improved by considering comorbidity as an independent 
      factor. Furthermore, ARDS post-processing clinical systems must involve include (i) 
      the clinical validation and verification of AI-models, (ii) reliability and 
      stability criteria, and (iii) easily adaptable, and (iv) generalization assessments 
      of AI systems for their use in pulmonary, critical care, and radiological settings.

TI  - Factors structuring temporal and spatial dynamics of macrobenthic communities in a 
      eutrophic coastal lagoon (Óbidos lagoon, Portugal).
PG  - 97-110
LID - 10.1016/j.marenvres.2010.11.005 [doi]
AB  - The present work aimed to identify the main environmental drivers shaping temporal 
      and spatial dynamics of macrobenthic communities within a eutrophic coastal lagoon. 
      Sediments in the Óbidos lagoon showed a gradient of increasing metal contamination 
      from the inlet area to inner branches. The mid-lower lagoon area exhibited an 
      intermediate contaminated condition between the inlet and upstream areas, suggesting 
      that the effects of the organic loadings into the lagoon may be reflected until this 
      area. This transitional feature was corroborated by biological data, with 
      macrobenthic assemblages displaying characteristics of down- and upstream areas. 
      Macrobenthic abundance peaked in winter, which was associated with a higher nutrient 
      availability (mainly ammonium) and the proliferation of green macroalgae in 
      mid-lower and inner lagoon areas. However, massive macroalgae growth resulted in a 
      sharp decrease of macrobenthic diversity and abundance in spring, particularly where 
      the higher amounts of decaying algae were detected. Higher dissimilarities between 
      assemblages were detected during winter (and spring, for trophic composition), while 
      in summer, differences were highly attenuated. The least contaminated area (close to 
      the sea inlet) experienced smaller temporal variations for environmental variables, 
      as well as the lowest temporal biological variability. This area was dominated by 
      carnivores, which were related with increased salinity. Deposit-feeders were 
      numerically dominant in the lagoon, being generally spread within organically 
      enriched sandy and muddy areas. The high concentration of chlorophyll a and 
      suspended particulate matter in water was reflected in the abundance of 
      deposit-feeders/suspension-feeders, taking benefit of the high primary productivity. 
      On the other hand, deposit-feeders/herbivores responded to the decay of macroalgae 
      mats in the sediment. Biological associations varied with the biological data used 
      (taxonomic versus trophic group composition; abundance versus biomass), highlighting 
      the relevance of the combination of different data analysis' approaches. In general, 
      BIOENV analysis indicated total phosphorus, biomass of Ulva, metals and organic 
      carbon and nitrogen as being significantly influencing benthic patterns. On the 
      other hand, discrepancies in ecological behaviours of some taxa were also detected 
      in the present study stressing the need for additional studies on the relationships 
      between macrobenthic communities and environmental variables. Implications of the 
      present results for monitoring studies are discussed.

TI  - A prospective randomised control study: reduction of children's pain expectation 
      using a picture book during blood withdrawal.
PG  - 110-4
LID - 10.1055/s-0033-1343481 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Blood drawings are very painful and stressful for children. In a 
      prospective control group study we investigated if using a picture book could reduce 
      the children's pain expectation. In addition, the children's pain experience and the 
      observed pain behaviour was monitored. PATIENTS/METHODS: Block-randomization were 
      used and 120 children at the age of 6-12 years who were visiting the general 
      pediatric and coagulation outpatient clinics were included in this study. Pain 
      expectation and experience were assessed with the Face-Pain-Scale-Revised and the 
      pain behavior with the Faces-Legs-Activity-Cry-Consolability Scale. Multivariate 
      covariance analysis was used for data analysis. RESULTS: The results showed that 
      with statistical controlling the influence of the primary pain expectation 
      (baseline) the pain expectation before blood withdrawal was reduced significantly 
      (p=0.001) and effectively (ES=0.56) using the picture book. Children who received no 
      local anaesthesia reported that they felt less pain during blood drawing after 
      reading the picture book. The few children with local anaesthesia reported no 
      benefit from the picture book. The observed use of local anaesthesia was very 
      heterogeneous. CONCLUSIONS: The results recommend the usage of this picture book in 
      everyday practice, if the use of local anaesthesia could not be used in an 
      appropriate way.

TI  - Positive changes in the medical educational environment following introduction of a 
      new systems-based curriculum: DREEM or reality? Curricular change and the 
      Environment.
PG  - 253-8
LID - 10.1007/s11845-013-1000-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evaluation of a new systems-based curriculum in an undergraduate Irish 
      Medical School was carried out with the validated Dundee Ready Educational 
      Environment (DREEM) inventory. Comparison was made with the results from a previous 
      DREEM study in the old curriculum. METHODS: DREEM was administered to 225 medical 
      students enrolled in the new curriculum. Data analysis was carried out using SPSS 
      17.0 and the Student unpaired t test. RESULTS: Increased mean scores supported 
      greater satisfaction with the educational environment in the new curriculum. 
      Students perceived better opportunities to develop interpersonal skills, ask 
      questions and learn about empathy. Areas of concern included timetabling, support 
      for stressed students and provision of feedback. Clinical students perceived their 
      overall environment more positively. Pre-clinical students were more confident about 
      passing exams and felt better prepared for clinical practice. Male students were 
      more positive about the environment and found the teaching more stimulating. Female 
      students perceived greater development of their problem-solving skills. Non-Irish 
      students no longer perceived the atmosphere and their social self-perceptions more 
      negative than Irish students, as was the case in the old curriculum. CONCLUSIONS: 
      DREEM is a valuable tool in evaluating the educational environment and monitoring 
      the impact of curricular change.

TI  - Glycemic control, coping, and internalizing and externalizing symptoms in 
      adolescents with type 1 diabetes: a cross-lagged longitudinal approach.
PG  - 1424-9
LID - 10.2337/dc09-2017 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study examines how active coping and withdrawal, psychological 
      (internalizing and externalizing) symptoms, and glycemic control (A1C values) 
      influence each other across time in adolescents with type 1 diabetes. RESEARCH 
      DESIGN AND METHODS: One hundred and nine adolescents participated in a four-wave 
      longitudinal study spanning four years (mean age at Time 1 was 13.77). Patients were 
      visited at home and completed questionnaires measuring coping and psychological 
      symptoms. The treating physicians were contacted to obtain A1C values. Cross-lagged 
      path analysis from a structural equation modeling approach was used for data 
      analysis. RESULTS: Clinically meaningful pathways between coping and glycemic 
      control were found across time. Active coping prospectively predicted lower A1C 
      levels, which, in turn, predicted active coping. Higher A1C levels and higher 
      psychological symptoms consistently predicted avoidance coping across time. Finally, 
      psychological symptomatology constituted an important link in the observed 
      longitudinal chain of effects. More specifically, higher A1C values and 
      symptomatology at Time 1 positively predicted withdrawal at Time 2, which, in turn, 
      positively predicted symptomatology at Time 3. Next, symptomatology at Time 3 
      positively predicted higher A1C values at Time 4, thus coming full circle. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Coping with everyday stress, psychological symptoms, and glycemic 
      control were interrelated across time. Evidence was obtained for reciprocal pathways 
      and mutually reinforcing mechanisms, indicating the need to monitor coping 
      strategies and psychological symptoms along with glycemic control in optimizing 
      clinical care in adolescents with type 1 diabetes.

TI  - Raman imaging reveals in-situ microchemistry of cuticle and epidermis of spruce 
      needles.
PG  - 17
LID - 10.1186/s13007-021-00717-6 [doi]
LID - 17
AB  - BACKGROUND: The cuticle is a protective layer playing an important role in plant 
      defense against biotic and abiotic stresses. So far cuticle structure and chemistry 
      was mainly studied by electron microscopy and chemical extraction. Thus, analysing 
      composition involved sample destruction and the link between chemistry and 
      microstructure remained unclear. In the last decade, Raman imaging showed high 
      potential to link plant anatomical structure with microchemistry and to give 
      insights into orientation of molecules. In this study, we use Raman imaging and 
      polarization experiments to study the native cuticle and epidermal layer of needles 
      of Norway spruce, one of the economically most important trees in Europe. The 
      acquired hyperspectral dataset is the basis to image the chemical heterogeneity 
      using univariate (band integration) as well as multivariate data analysis (cluster 
      analysis and non-negative matrix factorization). RESULTS: Confocal Raman microscopy 
      probes the cuticle together with the underlying epidermis in the native state and 
      tracks aromatics, lipids, carbohydrates and minerals with a spatial resolution of 
      300 nm. All three data analysis approaches distinguish a waxy, crystalline layer on 
      top, in which aliphatic chains and coumaric acid are aligned perpendicular to the 
      surface. Also in the lipidic amorphous cuticle beneath, strong signals of coumaric 
      acid and flavonoids are detected. Even the unmixing algorithm results in mixed 
      endmember spectra and confirms that lipids co-locate with aromatics. The underlying 
      epidermal cell walls are devoid of lipids but show strong aromatic Raman bands. 
      Especially the upper periclinal thicker cell wall is impregnated with aromatics. At 
      the interface between epidermis and cuticle Calcium oxalate crystals are detected in 
      a layer-like fashion. Non-negative matrix factorization gives the purest component 
      spectra, thus the best match with reference spectra and by this promotes band 
      assignments and interpretation of the visualized chemical heterogeneity. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Results sharpen our view about the cuticle as the outermost layer of 
      plants and highlight the aromatic impregnation throughout. In the future, 
      developmental studies tracking lipid and aromatic pathways might give new insights 
      into cuticle formation and comparative studies might deepen our understanding why 
      some trees and their needle and leaf surfaces are more resistant to biotic and 
      abiotic stresses than others.

AB  - We aimed at evaluating the effect of low-level air pollution on leaf area 
      fluctuating asymmetry (FAA) and specific leaf area (SLA) of Salix alba L., taking 
      into account other environmental factors. Cuttings were grown in standardized 
      conditions in the near vicinity of air quality measuring stations in Belgium. 
      Variability of SLA and FAA between measuring stations explained 83% and 7.26%, 
      respectively, of the total variability. FAA was not influenced by air pollution or 
      environmental factors such as shading, herbivory, air temperature and humidity. SLA 
      was increased by an increase in shadow, while NO(x) and O(3) concentrations had only 
      a marginal influence. The influence of SO(2) concentration was negligible. Although 
      our data analysis suggests a relationship between SLA and NO(x)/O(3) concentration, 
      the absence of a straightforward relationship between FAA and SLA and air pollution 
      still questions the usefulness of these bio-indicators for monitoring air pollution.

TI  - Evidence for the Stepwise Behavioral Response Model (SBRM): the effects of Carbamate 
      Pesticides on medaka (Oryzias latipes) in an online monitoring system.
PG  - 734-41
LID - 10.1016/j.chemosphere.2011.12.068 [doi]
AB  - The Stepwise Behavioral Response Model (SBRM), which is a conceptual model, 
      postulated that an organism displays a time-dependent sequence of compensatory 
      Stepwise Behavioral Response (SBR) during exposure to pollutants above their 
      respective thresholds of resistance. In order to prove the model, in this study, the 
      behavioral responses (BRs) of medaka (Oryzias latipes) in the exposure of Arprocarb 
      (A), Carbofuran (C) and Methomyl (M) were analyzed in an online monitoring system 
      (OMS). The Self-Organizing Map (SOM) was utilized for patterning the obtained 
      behavioral data in 0.1 TU (Toxic Unit), 1 TU, 2 TU, 5 TU, 10 TU and 20 TU treatments 
      with control. Some differences among different Carbamate Pesticides (CPs) were 
      observed in different concentrations and the profiles of behavior strength (BS) on 
      SOM were variable depending upon levels of concentration. The time of the first 
      significant decrease of BS (SD-BS) was in inverse ratio to the CP concentrations. 
      Movement behavior showed by medaka mainly included No effect, Stimulation, 
      Acclimation, Adjustment (Readjustment) and Toxic effect, which proved SBRM as a 
      time-dependence model based on the time series BS data. Meanwhile, it was found that 
      SBRM showed evident stress-dependence. Therefore, it was concluded that medaka SBR 
      was both stress-dependent and time-dependent, which supported and developed SBRM, 
      and data mining by SOM could be efficiently used to illustrate the behavioral 
      processes and to monitor toxic chemicals in the environment.

TI  - Intravenous vitamin C administration reduces fatigue in office workers: a 
      double-blind randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 7
LID - 10.1186/1475-2891-11-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies of the efficacy of vitamin C treatment for fatigue have yielded 
      inconsistent results. One of the reasons for this inconsistency could be the 
      difference in delivery routes. Therefore, we planned a clinical trial with 
      intravenous vitamin C administration. METHODS: We evaluated the effect of 
      intravenous vitamin C on fatigue in office workers. A group of 141 healthy 
      volunteers, aged 20 to 49 years participated in this randomized, double-blind, 
      controlled clinical trial. The trial group received 10 grams of vitamin C with 
      normal saline intravenously, while the placebo group received normal saline only. 
      Since vitamin C is a well-known antioxidant, oxidative stress was measured. Fatigue 
      score, oxidative stress, and plasma vitamin C levels were measured before 
      intervention, and again two hours and one day after intervention. Adverse events 
      were monitored. RESULTS: The fatigue scores measured at two hours after intervention 
      and one day after intervention were significantly different between the two groups 
      (p = 0.004); fatigue scores decreased in the vitamin C group after two hours and 
      remained lower for one day. Trial also led to higher plasma vitamin C levels and 
      lower oxidative stress compared to the placebo group (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, 
      respectively). When data analysis was refined by dividing each group into 
      high-baseline and low-baseline subgroups, it was observed that fatigue was reduced 
      in the lower baseline vitamin C level group after two hours and after one day (p = 
      0.004). The same did not hold for the higher baseline group (p = 0.206). CONCLUSION: 
      Thus, intravenous vitamin C reduced fatigue at two hours, and the effect persisted 
      for one day. There were no significant differences in adverse events between two 
      groups. High dose intravenous vitamin C proved to be safe and effective against 
      fatigue in this study. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The clinical trial registration of this 
      trial is http://ClinicalTrials.govNCT00633581.

TI  - Association of Patient Mental Health Status With the Level of Agreement Between 
      Patient and Physician Ratings of Psoriasis Severity.
LID - 10.1001/jamadermatol.2020.5844 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: The emerging paradigm of treat-to-target in psoriasis requires accurate 
      monitoring of treatment response. The commonly used physician global assessment tool 
      does not capture the patient's perception of their disease. Patient assessments 
      facilitate shared decision-making and foster patient-centered care; however, recent 
      research reports a discordance between patient- and physician-reported psoriasis 
      severity. Understanding the factors underlying this discordance may improve 
      treatment satisfaction and disease outcomes. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the discordance 
      between patient- and physician-reported measures of psoriasis severity and assess 
      the association with patient mental health status. DESIGN, SETTING, AND 
      PARTICIPANTS: A cohort study using repeated cross-sectional analysis of real-world 
      longitudinal data was conducted at a large specialist psoriasis service serving 
      London and Southeast England. A total of 502 patients attending the psoriasis 
      service between May 12, 2016, and November 1, 2018, were included. Data analysis was 
      conducted July 22 to October 22, 2019. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Psoriasis 
      severity was assessed on each visit with identical 5-point physician and patient 
      global assessment scales (clear/nearly clear, mild, moderate, severe, and very 
      severe). Each patient completed validated self-report screens for depression and 
      anxiety on each visit. RESULTS: Longitudinal data from 502 individuals with 
      psoriasis (1985 total observations) were available. A total of 339 patients (68%) 
      were men, 396 (79%) were White, mean (SD) age was 47 (13) years, and 197 patients 
      (39%) had concurrent psoriatic arthritis, 43 (9%) screened positive for depression, 
      and 49 (10%) screened positive for anxiety. There was discordance between physician 
      and patient measures of disease severity in 768 of 1985 office appointments (39%); 
      on 511 visits (26%) patients rated their psoriasis as less severe and on 257 visits 
      (13%) patients rated their psoriasis as more severe compared with their physician. 
      Individuals who screened positive for depression or anxiety were more likely to 
      overestimate their psoriasis severity compared with their physician (relative risk 
      ratio: depression, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.6-4.5; anxiety, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.3-3.4). These 
      findings remained statistically significant after adjustment for age, ethnicity, 
      sex, body mass index, smoking, number of comorbidities, treatment modality, and 
      presence of psoriatic arthritis. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this 
      cohort study suggest that discordance between patient and physician assessments of 
      psoriasis severity is associated with patients' mental health status. Recognition of 
      anxiety and depression in individuals with psoriasis appears to be important when 
      interpreting patient-reported outcome measures and informing appropriate treatment 
      decisions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau 
      provided updates on the novel coronavirus and the government's responses to the 
      pandemic in his daily briefings from March 13 to May 22, 2020, delivered on the 
      official Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) YouTube channel. OBJECTIVE: The aim 
      of this study was to examine comments on Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau's COVID-19 
      daily briefings by YouTube users and track these comments to extract the changing 
      dynamics of the opinions and concerns of the public over time. METHODS: We used 
      machine learning techniques to longitudinally analyze a total of 46,732 English 
      YouTube comments that were retrieved from 57 videos of Prime Minister Trudeau's 
      COVID-19 daily briefings from March 13 to May 22, 2020. A natural language 
      processing model, latent Dirichlet allocation, was used to choose salient topics 
      among the sampled comments for each of the 57 videos. Thematic analysis was used to 
      classify and summarize these salient topics into different prominent themes. 
      RESULTS: We found 11 prominent themes, including strict border measures, public 
      responses to Prime Minister Trudeau's policies, essential work and frontline 
      workers, individuals' financial challenges, rental and mortgage subsidies, 
      quarantine, government financial aid for enterprises and individuals, personal 
      protective equipment, Canada and China's relationship, vaccines, and reopening. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to longitudinally investigate public discourse 
      and concerns related to Prime Minister Trudeau's daily COVID-19 briefings in Canada. 
      This study contributes to establishing a real-time feedback loop between the public 
      and public health officials on social media. Hearing and reacting to real concerns 
      from the public can enhance trust between the government and the public to prepare 
      for future health emergencies.

TI  - Efficient Anomaly Detection for Smart Hospital IoT Systems.
LID - 10.3390/s21041026 [doi]

AB  - In critical Internet of Things (IoT) application domains, such as the Defense 
      Industry and Healthcare, false alerts have many negative effects, such as fear, 
      disruption of emergency services, and waste of resources. Therefore, an alert must 
      only be sent if triggered by a correct event. Nevertheless, IoT networks are exposed 
      to intrusions, which affects event detection accuracy. In this paper, an Anomaly 
      Detection System (ADS) is proposed in a smart hospital IoT system for detecting 
      events of interest about patients' health and environment and, at the same time, for 
      network intrusions. Providing a single system for network infrastructure supervision 
      and e-health monitoring has been shown to optimize resources and enforce the system 
      reliability. Consequently, decisions regarding patients' care and their 
      environments' adaptation are more accurate. The low latency is ensured, thanks to a 
      deployment on the edge to allow for a processing close to data sources. The proposed 
      ADS is implemented and evaluated while using Contiki Cooja simulator and the 
      e-health event detection is based on a realistic data-set analysis. The results show 
      a high detection accuracy for both e-health related events and IoT network 
      intrusions.

AB  - The amygdala has a pivotal role in processing traumatic stress; hence, gaining 
      control over its activity could facilitate adaptive mechanism and recovery. To date, 
      amygdala volitional regulation could be obtained only via real-time functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a highly inaccessible procedure. The current 
      article presents high-impact neurobehavioral implications of a novel imaging 
      approach that enables bedside monitoring of amygdala activity using fMRI-inspired 
      electroencephalography (EEG), hereafter termed amygdala-electrical fingerprint 
      (amyg-EFP). Simultaneous EEG/fMRI indicated that the amyg-EFP reliably predicts 
      amygdala-blood oxygen level-dependent activity. Implementing the amyg-EFP in 
      neurofeedback demonstrated that learned downregulation of the amyg-EFP facilitated 
      volitional downregulation of amygdala-blood oxygen level-dependent activity via 
      real-time fMRI and manifested as reduced amygdala reactivity to visual stimuli. 
      Behavioral evidence further emphasized the therapeutic potential of this approach by 
      showing improved implicit emotion regulation following amyg-EFP neurofeedback. 
      Additional EFP models denoting different brain regions could provide a library of 
      localized activity for low-cost and highly accessible brain-based diagnosis and 
      treatment.

TI  - Harnessing SmartPhones to Personalize Nutrition in a Time of Global Pandemic.
LID - 10.3390/nu13020422 [doi]
LID - 422
AB  - The soar in COVID-19 cases around the globe has forced many to adapt to social 
      distancing and self-isolation. In order to reduce contact with healthcare facilities 
      and other patients, the CDC has advocated the use of telemedicine, i.e., electronic 
      information and telecommunication technology. While these changes may disrupt normal 
      behaviors and routines and induce anxiety, resulting in decreased vigilance to 
      healthy diet and physical activity and reluctance to seek medical attention, they 
      may just as well be circumvented using modern technology. Indeed, as the beginning 
      of the pandemic a plethora of alternatives to conventional physical interactions 
      were introduced. In this Perspective, we portray the role of SmartPhone applications 
      (apps) in monitoring healthy nutrition, from their basic functionality as food 
      diaries required for simple decision-making and nutritional interventions, through 
      more advanced purposes, such as multi-dimensional data-mining and development of 
      machine learning algorithms. Finally, we will delineate the emerging field of 
      personalized nutrition and introduce pioneering technologies and concepts yet to be 
      incorporated in SmartPhone-based dietary surveillance.

AB  - In this work, we extend to the multivariate case the classical correlation analysis 
      used in the field of network physiology to probe dynamic interactions between organ 
      systems in the human body. To this end, we define different correlation-based 
      measures of the multivariate interaction (MI) within and between the brain and body 
      subnetworks of the human physiological network, represented, respectively, by the 
      time series of δ, θ, α, and β electroencephalographic (EEG) wave amplitudes, and of 
      heart rate, respiration amplitude, and pulse arrival time (PAT) variability (η, ρ, 
      π). MI is computed: (i) considering all variables in the two subnetworks to evaluate 
      overall brain-body interactions; (ii) focusing on a single target variable and 
      dissecting its global interaction with all other variables into contributions 
      arising from the same subnetwork and from the other subnetwork; and (iii) 
      considering two variables conditioned to all the others to infer the network 
      topology. The framework is applied to the time series measured from the EEG, 
      electrocardiographic (ECG), respiration, and blood volume pulse (BVP) signals 
      recorded synchronously via wearable sensors in a group of healthy subjects monitored 
      at rest and during mental arithmetic and sustained attention tasks. We find that the 
      human physiological network is highly connected, with predominance of the links 
      internal of each subnetwork (mainly η-ρ and δ-θ, θ-α, α-β), but also statistically 
      significant interactions between the two subnetworks (mainly η-β and η-δ). MI values 
      are often spatially heterogeneous across the scalp and are modulated by the 
      physiological state, as indicated by the decrease of cardiorespiratory interactions 
      during sustained attention and by the increase of brain-heart interactions and of 
      brain-brain interactions at the frontal scalp regions during mental arithmetic. 
      These findings illustrate the complex and multi-faceted structure of interactions 
      manifested within and between different physiological systems and subsystems across 
      different levels of mental stress.

TI  - New Seasonal Shift in In-Stream Diurnal Nitrate Cycles Identified by Mining 
      High-Frequency Data.

AB  - The recent development of in-situ monitoring devices, such as UV-spectrometers, 
      makes the study of short-term stream chemistry variation relevant, especially the 
      study of diurnal cycles, which are not yet fully understood. Our study is based on 
      high-frequency data from an agricultural catchment (Studienlandschaft 
      Schwingbachtal, Germany). We propose a novel approach, i.e. the combination of 
      cluster analysis and Linear Discriminant Analysis, to mine from these data nitrate 
      behavior patterns. As a result, we observe a seasonality of nitrate diurnal cycles, 
      that differs from the most common cycle seasonality described in the literature, 
      i.e. pre-dawn peaks in spring. Our cycles appear in summer and the maximum and 
      minimum shift to a later time in late summer/autumn. This is observed both for 
      water- and energy-limited years, thus potentially stressing the role of 
      evapotranspiration. This concluding hypothesis on the role of evapotranspiration on 
      nitrate stream concentration, which was obtained through data mining, broadens the 
      perspective on the diurnal cycling of stream nitrate concentrations.

TI  - A neuron-benign microfluidic gradient generator for studying the response of 
      mammalian neurons towards axon guidance factors.
PG  - 669-79
LID - 10.1039/c0ib00038h [doi]
AB  - Investigation of biochemical cues in isolation or in combinations in cell culture 
      systems is crucial for unraveling the mechanisms that govern neural development and 
      repair. The most widely used experimental paradigms that elicit axon guidance in 
      vitro utilize as the source of the gradient a pulsatile pipette, transfected cells, 
      or a loaded gel, producing time-varying gradients of poor reproducibility which are 
      not well suited for studying slow-growing mammalian cells. Although microfluidic 
      device design have allowed for generating stable, complex gradients of diffusible 
      molecules, the flow-induced shear forces in a microchannel has made it impossible to 
      maintain viable mammalian neuronal cultures for sufficiently long times. In this 
      paper, we describe axonal responses of mouse cortical neurons in a "neuron-benign" 
      gradient-generator device based on an open chamber that can establish highly stable 
      gradients of diffusible molecules for at least 6 h with negligible shear stress, and 
      also allows the neurons to thrive for at least 2 weeks. Except for the period when 
      the gradient is on, the cells in the gradient are under the same conditions as the 
      cells on the control surfaces, which ensure a consistent set of micro-environmental 
      variables. The gradient stability and uniformity over the cell culture surface 
      achieved by the device, together with our software platform for acquiring, 
      post-processing and quantitatively analyzing the large number of images allowed us 
      to extract valuable information even from small datasets. We report a directed 
      response of primary mammalian neurons (from E14 embryonic mice cortex) to a 
      diffusible gradient of netrin in vitro. We infer from our studies that a large 
      majority (∼73%) of the neurons that extend axons during the gradient application 
      grow towards the netrin source, and our data analysis also indicates that netrin 
      acts as a growth factor for this same population of neurons.

TI  - Novel computational identification of highly selective biomarkers of pollutant 
      exposure.
PG  - 5132-8
LID - 10.1021/es200065f [doi]
AB  - The use of in vivo biosensors to acquire environmental pollution data is an emerging 
      and promising paradigm. One major challenge is the identification of highly specific 
      biomarkers that selectively report exposure to a target pollutant, while remaining 
      quiescent under a diverse set of other, often unknown, environmental conditions. 
      This study hypothesized that a microarray data mining approach can identify highly 
      specific biomarkers, and, that the robustness property can generalize to unforeseen 
      environmental conditions. Starting with Arabidopsis thaliana microarray data 
      measuring responses to a variety of treatments, the study used the top scoring pair 
      (TSP) algorithm to identify mRNA transcripts that respond uniquely to phenanthrene, 
      a model polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. Subsequent in silico analysis with a larger 
      set of microarray data indicated that the biomarkers remained robust under new 
      conditions. Finally, in vivo experiments were performed with unforeseen conditions 
      that mimic phenanthrene stress, and the biomarkers were assayed using qRT-PCR. In 
      these experiments, the biomarkers always responded positively to phenanthrene, and 
      never responded to the unforeseen conditions, thereby supporting the hypotheses. 
      This data mining approach requires only microarray or next-generation RNA-seq data, 
      and, in principle, can be applied to arbitrary biomonitoring organisms and chemical 
      exposures.

LID - 620070
AB  - OBJECTIV E: To summarise current evidence for the utility of interval imaging in 
      monitoring disease in adult brain tumours, and to develop a position for future 
      evidence gathering while incorporating the application of data science and health 
      economics. METHODS: Experts in 'interval imaging' (imaging at pre-planned 
      time-points to assess tumour status); data science; health economics, trial 
      management of adult brain tumours, and patient representatives convened in London, 
      UK. The current evidence on the use of interval imaging for monitoring brain tumours 
      was reviewed. To improve the evidence that interval imaging has a role in disease 
      management, we discussed specific themes of data science, health economics, 
      statistical considerations, patient and carer perspectives, and multi-centre study 
      design. Suggestions for future studies aimed at filling knowledge gaps were 
      discussed. RESULTS: Meningioma and glioma were identified as priorities for interval 
      imaging utility analysis. The "monitoring biomarkers" most commonly used in adult 
      brain tumour patients were standard structural MRI features. Interval imaging was 
      commonly scheduled to provide reported imaging prior to planned, regular clinic 
      visits. There is limited evidence relating interval imaging in the absence of 
      clinical deterioration to management change that alters morbidity, mortality, 
      quality of life, or resource use. Progression-free survival is confounded as an 
      outcome measure when using structural MRI in glioma. Uncertainty from imaging causes 
      distress for some patients and their caregivers, while for others it provides an 
      important indicator of disease activity. Any study design that changes imaging 
      regimens should consider the potential for influencing current or planned 
      therapeutic trials, ensure that opportunity costs are measured, and capture indirect 
      benefits and added value. CONCLUSION: Evidence for the value, and therefore utility, 
      of regular interval imaging is currently lacking. Ongoing collaborative efforts will 
      improve trial design and generate the evidence to optimise monitoring imaging 
      biomarkers in standard of care brain tumour management.

TI  - Early postoperative delirium after open-heart cardiac surgery is associated with 
      decreased bispectral EEG and increased cortisol and interleukin-6.
PG  - 2081-9
LID - 10.1007/s00134-010-2004-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: It is difficult to substantiate the clinical diagnosis of postoperative 
      delirium with objective parameters in intensive care units (ICU). The purpose of 
      this study was to analyze (1) whether the bilateral bispectral (BIS) index, (2) 
      cortisol as a stress marker, and (3) interleukin-6 as a marker of inflammation were 
      different in delirious patients as compared to nondelirious ones after cardiac 
      surgery. METHODS: On the first postoperative day, delirium was analyzed in 114 
      patients by using the confusion assessment method for ICU (CAM-ICU). Bilateral BIS 
      data were determined; immediately thereafter plasma samples were drawn to analyze 
      patients' blood characteristics. The current ICU medication, hemodynamic 
      characteristics, SOFA and APACHE II scores, and artificial ventilation were noted. 
      RESULTS: Delirium was detected at 19.1 ± 4.8 h after the end of surgery in 32 of 114 
      patients (28%). Delirious patients were significantly older than nondelirious ones 
      and were artificially ventilated 4.7-fold more often during the testing. In 
      delirious patients, plasma cortisol and interleukin-6 levels were higher (p = 0.01). 
      The mean BIS index was significantly lower in delirious patients (72.6 (69.6-89.1); 
      median [interquartile range (IQR), 25th-75th percentiles] than in nondelirious 
      patients, 84.8 (76.8-89.9). BIS EEG raw data analysis detected significant lower 
      relative alpha and higher theta power. A significant correlation was found between 
      plasma cortisol levels and BIS index. CONCLUSIONS: Early postoperative delirium 
      after cardiac surgery was characterized by increased stress levels and inflammatory 
      reaction. BIS index measurements showed lower cortical activity in delirious 
      patients with a low sensitivity (27%) and high specificity (96%).

TI  - A RCT of telehealth for COPD patient's quality of life: the whole system 
      demonstrator evaluation.
PG  - 459-469
LID - 10.1111/crj.12359 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION/OBJECTIVES: Despite some concerns that the introduction of telehealth 
      (TH) may lead to reductions in quality of life (QoL), lower mood and increased 
      anxiety in response to using assistive technologies to reduce health care 
      utilisation and manage long term conditions, this research focuses on the extent to 
      which providing people with tools to monitor their condition can improve QoL. 
      METHODS: The Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) cohort of the Whole 
      Systems Demonstrator Trial is a pragmatic General Practitioner (GP) clustered 
      randomised controlled trial (RCT) evaluating TH in the UK from three regions in 
      England. All patients at a participating GP practice were deemed eligible for 
      inclusion in the study if they were diagnosed with COPD. RESULTS: 447 participants 
      completed baseline and either a short (4 months) or long term (12 months) follow-up. 
      There was a trend of improved QoL and mood in the TH group at longer-term follow-up, 
      but not short term follow-up. Emotional functioning (g = 0.280 95%CI, 0.051-0.510) 
      and mastery reached (g = 2.979 95%CI, 0-0.46) significance at P < 0.05 (all Hedges g 
      <0.3). CONCLUSIONS: TH showed minimal benefit to QoL in COPD patients who were not 
      preselected to be at increased risk of acute exacerbations. Benefits were more 
      likely in disease specific measures at longer term follow-up. TH is a complex 
      intervention and should be embedded in a service that is evidenced based. Outcome 
      measures must be sensitive enough to detect changes in the target population for the 
      specific intervention.

TI  - Automatic mental health identification method based on natural gait pattern.
LID - 10.1002/pchj.434 [doi]
AB  - Mental health has become a global problem, as over 300 million people worldwide 
      suffer from depression and 200 million from anxiety disorders, which are ranked by 
      the World Health Organization (WHO) as the first and sixth leading causes of 
      disability, respectively. Due to the limited health resources, the traditional 
      method of mental health diagnosis as one-to-one consultation is difficult to meet 
      the needs of the large number of mental subhealth population. In this article, we 
      propose a new method for mental health recognition that could identify potentially 
      clinically significant symptoms of depression and anxiety based on daily gait. 
      Eighty-eight participants were recruited, and their gaits were recorded by a digital 
      camera. Then they were required to complete two rating scales, the Patient Health 
      Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), 
      to measure their depression and anxiety levels. Specifically, 18 key points of each 
      individual's body trunk were captured from video, and both time-domain features and 
      frequency-domain behavioral features were extracted for each key point. Lastly, 
      machine-learning algorithms were utilized to build the mental health recognition 
      models. Results showed that the proposed method is feasible and effective, with a 
      correlation coefficient of depression (measured by PHQ-9) recognition above 0.5 and 
      anxiety (measured by GAD-7) recognition above 0.4, achieving medium correlation. 
      This new, low-cost, and convenient mental health recognition pattern could be 
      applied in daily monitoring of mental health and large-scale preliminary screening 
      of mental diseases.

TI  - [18F]fluoroethyltyrosine-positron emission tomography-based therapy monitoring after 
      stereotactic iodine-125 brachytherapy in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma.
PG  - 137-47
AB  - Therapy monitoring of glioma after stereotactic iodine-125 brachytherapy (SBT) 
      remains challenging because posttherapeutic changes in magnetic resonance imaging 
      can mimic tumor progression. We evaluated the prognostic value of serial 
      [18F]fluoroethyltyrosine (FET)-positron emission tomographic (PET) scans for therapy 
      monitoring of high-grade glioma (HGG) after SBT. Thirty-three patients with 
      recurrent HGG were included. Serial FET-PET scans were performed prior to 
      therapeutic intervention and at 3-month intervals during the first year after SBT. 
      FET-PET evaluation was performed by both conventional data analysis and kinetic 
      analysis. Prognostic factors were obtained from proportional hazard models. Median 
      local progression-free survival (LPFS) was 11.1 months. Maximal standardized 
      background uptake value (SUVmax/BG) and biologic tumor volume (BTV) differentiated 
      accurately between therapeutic effects and local tumor progression at the 6-month 
      and subsequent examinations. Increasing uptake kinetics at baseline (p < .05) and 
      during follow-up (p < .01) were stringently associated with a longer LPFS. Early 
      increase in FET uptake after SBT is not unequivocally associated with tumor 
      progression; it might be induced by reactive changes and could easily lead to a 
      misclassification of the tumor status (pseudoprogression). Six months after SBT (or 
      later), however, increased SUVmax/BG and BTV values are associated with a worse 
      prognosis. Multivariate analysis stresses the prognostic importance of dynamic 
      studies.

TI  - Impedance sensor technology for cell-based assays in the framework of a high-content 
      screening system.
PG  - 977-93
LID - 10.1088/0967-3334/32/7/S18 [doi]
AB  - Living cultured cells react to external influences, such as pharmaceutical agents, 
      in an intricate manner due to their complex internal signal processing. Impedance 
      sensing of cells on microelectrodes is a favored label-free technology to indicate 
      cellular events, usually ascribed to morphologic alteration or changes in cellular 
      adhesion, which is usually found in stand-alone systems that do not incorporate life 
      support or additional sensor systems. However, only in symbiosis with metabolic 
      activity sensing and picture documentation may a complete insight into cellular 
      vitality be provided. This complement was created within the framework of an 
      automated high-content screening system previously developed by our group, 
      monitoring 24 cell culture chambers in parallel. The objective of this paper is the 
      development of miniaturized electronics for impedance measurements and its system 
      integration as a modular unit. In addition, it is shown how sensor electrodes were 
      optimized by impedance matching such that spectroscopy and raw data analysis become 
      feasible for every culture well. Undesired mechanical stress on cultured cells may 
      arise from the medium and agent support system of the autonomous screening 
      apparatus. This paper demonstrates how this hazard is treated with the simulation of 
      microfluidics and impedance measurements. Physiological data are subsequently 
      derived from the exemplary tumor cell line MCF-7 both during treatment with the 
      agent doxorubicin and through the impact of natural killer cells. This correlates 
      the information content of complex impedance spectra with cellular respiration as 
      well as data from microscopy.

TI  - Suicide care from the nursing perspective: A meta-synthesis of qualitative studies.
LID - 10.1111/jan.14789 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To explore nurses' experiences of suicide care and to identify and synthesize 
      the most suitable interventions for the care of people with suicidal behaviour from 
      a nursing perspective. DESIGN: Qualitative meta-synthesis. DATA SOURCES: 
      Comprehensive search of five electronic databases for qualitative studies published 
      between January 2015 and June 2019. REVIEW METHODS: The PRISMA statement was used 
      for reporting the different phases of the literature search and the Critical 
      Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) qualitative research checklist was used as an 
      appraisal framework. Data synthesis was conducted using Sandelowski and Barroso's 
      method. RESULTS: Seventeen articles met the inclusion criteria. The data analysis 
      revealed 13 subcategories from which four main categories emerged: 'Understanding 
      suicidal behaviour as a consequence of suffering', 'Nurses' personal distress in 
      suicide care', 'The presence of the nurse as the axis of suicide care' and, 
      'Improving nurses' relational competences for a better therapeutic environment'. 
      CONCLUSION: Further training of nurses on the therapeutic relationship, particularly 
      in non-mental health care work settings, and monitoring of the emotional impact on 
      nurses in relation to suicide is required to promote more effective prevention and 
      care. IMPACT: This review provides new insights on how suicide is interpreted, the 
      associated emotions, the way suicide is approached and proposals for improving 
      clinical practice from the point of view of nurses. The results demonstrate that the 
      nurse-patient relationship, ongoing assessment, and the promotion of a sense of 
      security and hope are critical in nursing care for patients who exhibit suicidal 
      behaviour. Consequently, to promote an effective nursing care of suicide, nurses 
      should be provided with further training on the therapeutic relationship. Thus, 
      health institutions do not only provide the time and space to conduct an adequate 
      therapeutic relationship, but also, through their managers, they should supervise 
      and address the emotional impact that is generated in nurses caring for patients who 
      exhibit suicidal behaviour.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a disease that requires complex 
      management involving multiple medications, exercise, and lifestyle changes. It 
      mainly affects older patients with depression and anxiety, who commonly find 
      management difficult. Existing mobile apps supporting the self-management of CHF 
      have limited features and are inadequately validated. OBJECTIVE: The HeartMan 
      project aims to develop a personal health system that would comprehensively address 
      CHF self-management by using sensing devices and artificial intelligence methods. 
      This paper presents the design of the system and reports on the accuracy of its 
      patient-monitoring methods, overall effectiveness, and patient perceptions. METHODS: 
      A mobile app was developed as the core of the HeartMan system, and the app was 
      connected to a custom wristband and cloud services. The system features machine 
      learning methods for patient monitoring: continuous blood pressure (BP) estimation, 
      physical activity monitoring, and psychological profile recognition. These methods 
      feed a decision support system that provides recommendations on physical health and 
      psychological support. The system was designed using a human-centered methodology 
      involving the patients throughout development. It was evaluated in a 
      proof-of-concept trial with 56 patients. RESULTS: Fairly high accuracy of the 
      patient-monitoring methods was observed. The mean absolute error of BP estimation 
      was 9.0 mm Hg for systolic BP and 7.0 mm Hg for diastolic BP. The accuracy of 
      psychological profile detection was 88.6%. The F-measure for physical activity 
      recognition was 71%. The proof-of-concept clinical trial in 56 patients showed that 
      the HeartMan system significantly improved self-care behavior (P=.02), whereas 
      depression and anxiety rates were significantly reduced (P<.001), as were perceived 
      sexual problems (P=.01). According to the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of 
      Technology questionnaire, a positive attitude toward HeartMan was seen among end 
      users, resulting in increased awareness, self-monitoring, and empowerment. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The HeartMan project combined a range of advanced technologies with 
      human-centered design to develop a complex system that was shown to help patients 
      with CHF. More psychological than physical benefits were observed. TRIAL

TI  - Understanding Concerns, Sentiments, and Disparities Among Population Groups During 
      the COVID-19 Pandemic Via Twitter Data Mining: Large-scale Cross-sectional Study.
PG  - e26482
LID - 10.2196/26482 [doi]
LID - e26482
AB  - BACKGROUND: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in late 2019, its 
      far-reaching impacts have been witnessed globally across all aspects of human life, 
      such as health, economy, politics, and education. Such widely penetrating impacts 
      cast significant and profound burdens on all population groups, incurring varied 
      concerns and sentiments among them. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify the 
      concerns, sentiments, and disparities of various population groups during the 
      COVID-19 pandemic through a cross-sectional study conducted via large-scale Twitter 
      data mining infoveillance. METHODS: This study consisted of three steps: first, 
      tweets posted during the pandemic were collected and preprocessed on a large scale; 
      second, the key population attributes, concerns, sentiments, and emotions were 
      extracted via a collection of natural language processing procedures; third, 
      multiple analyses were conducted to reveal concerns, sentiments, and disparities 
      among population groups during the pandemic. Overall, this study implemented a 
      quick, effective, and economical approach for analyzing population-level disparities 
      during a public health event. The source code developed in this study was released 
      for free public use at GitHub. RESULTS: A total of 1,015,655 original English tweets 
      posted from August 7 to 12, 2020, were acquired and analyzed to obtain the following 
      results. Organizations were significantly more concerned about COVID-19 (odds ratio 
      [OR] 3.48, 95% CI 3.39-3.58) and expressed more fear and depression emotions than 
      individuals. Females were less concerned about COVID-19 (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.71-0.75) 
      and expressed less fear and depression emotions than males. Among all age groups 
      (ie, ≤18, 19-29, 30-39, and ≥40 years of age), the attention ORs of COVID-19 fear 
      and depression increased significantly with age. It is worth noting that not all 
      females paid less attention to COVID-19 than males. In the age group of 40 years or 
      older, females were more concerned than males, especially regarding the economic and 
      education topics. In addition, males 40 years or older and 18 years or younger were 
      the least positive. Lastly, in all sentiment analyses, the sentiment polarities 
      regarding political topics were always the lowest among the five topics of concern 
      across all population groups. CONCLUSIONS: Through large-scale Twitter data mining, 
      this study revealed that meaningful differences regarding concerns and sentiments 
      about COVID-19-related topics existed among population groups during the study 
      period. Therefore, specialized and varied attention and support are needed for 
      different population groups. In addition, the efficient analysis method implemented 
      by our publicly released code can be utilized to dynamically track the evolution of 
      each population group during the pandemic or any other major event for better 
      informed public health research and interventions.

TI  - Electron tomography of cryofixed, isometrically contracting insect flight muscle 
      reveals novel actin-myosin interactions.
LID - e12643 [pii]
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0012643 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Isometric muscle contraction, where force is generated without muscle 
      shortening, is a molecular traffic jam in which the number of actin-attached motors 
      is maximized and all states of motor action are trapped with consequently high 
      heterogeneity. This heterogeneity is a major limitation to deciphering myosin 
      conformational changes in situ. METHODOLOGY: We used multivariate data analysis to 
      group repeat segments in electron tomograms of isometrically contracting insect 
      flight muscle, mechanically monitored, rapidly frozen, freeze substituted, and thin 
      sectioned. Improved resolution reveals the helical arrangement of F-actin subunits 
      in the thin filament enabling an atomic model to be built into the thin filament 
      density independent of the myosin. Actin-myosin attachments can now be assigned as 
      weak or strong by their motor domain orientation relative to actin. Myosin 
      attachments were quantified everywhere along the thin filament including troponin. 
      Strong binding myosin attachments are found on only four F-actin subunits, the 
      "target zone", situated exactly midway between successive troponin complexes. They 
      show an axial lever arm range of 77°/12.9 nm. The lever arm azimuthal range of 
      strong binding attachments has a highly skewed, 127° range compared with X-ray 
      crystallographic structures. Two types of weak actin attachments are described. One 
      type, found exclusively in the target zone, appears to represent pre-working-stroke 
      intermediates. The other, which contacts tropomyosin rather than actin, is 
      positioned M-ward of the target zone, i.e. the position toward which thin filaments 
      slide during shortening. CONCLUSION: We present a model for the weak to strong 
      transition in the myosin ATPase cycle that incorporates azimuthal movements of the 
      motor domain on actin. Stress/strain in the S2 domain may explain azimuthal lever 
      arm changes in the strong binding attachments. The results support previous 
      conclusions that the weak attachments preceding force generation are very different 
      from strong binding attachments.

LID - 10.1039/c5lc00351b [doi]
AB  - Coupling analog frequency modulation (FM) to the driving stimulus in active 
      microrheology measurements conducted with optical tweezers effectively parallelizes 
      numerous single-frequency experiments. Consequently, frequency modulated 
      microrheology (FMMR) can efficiently characterize the dynamic stress response of 
      complex fluids over several frequency decades in a single experiment. The time 
      required to complete an FMMR measurement scales with the lowest frequency probed, 
      improving throughput over the serial frequency sweep approach. The ease of 
      implementation, straight-forward data analysis and rapidity of FMMR offer particular 
      utility toward applications such as characterization of non-equilibrium materials, 
      automated microrheology instrumentation, high-throughput screening of biomaterials 
      and (bio) pharmaceutical formulations, and in situ monitoring of chemical and 
      biochemical reaction processes.

TI  - Pyrosequencing-based transcriptomic resources in the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis, 
      with a focus on genes involved in molecular response to diquat-induced stress.
PG  - 2222-34
LID - 10.1007/s10646-012-0977-1 [doi]
AB  - Due to their ability to explore whole genome response to drugs and stressors, 
      omics-based approaches are widely used in toxicology and ecotoxicology, and 
      identified as powerful tools for future ecological risk assessment and environmental 
      monitoring programs. Understanding the long-term effects of contaminants may indeed 
      benefit from the coupling of genomics and eco-evolutionary hypotheses. 
      Next-generation sequencing provides a new way to investigate pollutants impact, by 
      targeting early responses, screening chemicals, and directly quantifying gene 
      expression, even in organisms without reference genome. Lymnaea stagnalis is a 
      freshwater mollusk in which access to genomic resources is critical for many 
      scientific issues, especially in ecotoxicology. We used 454-pyrosequencing to obtain 
      new transcriptomic resources in L. stagnalis and to preliminarily explore gene 
      expression response to a redox-cycling pesticide, diquat. We obtained 151,967 and 
      128,945 high-quality reads from control and diquat-exposed individuals, 
      respectively. Sequence assembly provided 141,999 contigs, of which 124,387 were 
      singletons. BlastX search revealed significant match for 34.6 % of the contigs (21.2 
      % protein hits). KEGG annotation showed a predominance of hits with genes involved 
      in energy metabolism and circulatory system, and revealed more than 400 putative 
      genes involved in oxidative stress, cellular/molecular stress and signaling 
      pathways, apoptosis, and metabolism of xenobiotics. Results also suggest that diquat 
      may have a great diversity of molecular effects. Moreover, new genetic markers 
      (putative SNPs) were discovered. We also created a Ensembl-like web-tool for 
      data-mining ( 
      http://genotoul-contigbrowser.toulouse.inra.fr:9095/Lymnaea_stagnalis/index.html ). 
      This resource is expected to be relevant for any genomic approach aimed at 
      understanding the molecular basis of physiological and evolutionary responses to 
      environmental stress in L. stagnalis.

LID - 10.3390/s140100848 [doi]
AB  - In this paper, we propose an intelligent method, named the Novelty Detection Power 
      Meter (NodePM), to detect novelties in electronic equipment monitored by a smart 
      grid. Considering the entropy of each device monitored, which is calculated based on 
      a Markov chain model, the proposed method identifies novelties through a machine 
      learning algorithm. To this end, the NodePM is integrated into a platform for the 
      remote monitoring of energy consumption, which consists of a wireless sensors 
      network (WSN). It thus should be stressed that the experiments were conducted in 
      real environments different from many related works, which are evaluated in 
      simulated environments. In this sense, the results show that the NodePM reduces by 
      13.7% the power consumption of the equipment we monitored. In addition, the NodePM 
      provides better efficiency to detect novelties when compared to an approach from the 
      literature, surpassing it in different scenarios in all evaluations that were 
      carried out.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cancer and its treatment can significantly impact the short- and 
      long-term psychological well-being of patients and families. Emotional distress and 
      depressive symptomatology are often associated with poor treatment adherence, 
      reduced quality of life, and higher mortality. Cancer support groups, especially 
      those led by health care professionals, provide a safe place for participants to 
      discuss fear, normalize stress reactions, share solidarity, and learn about 
      effective strategies to build resilience and enhance coping. However, in-person 
      support groups may not always be accessible to individuals; geographic distance is 
      one of the barriers for access, and compromised physical condition (eg, fatigue, 
      pain) is another. Emerging evidence supports the effectiveness of online support 
      groups in reducing access barriers. Text-based and professional-led online support 
      groups have been offered by Cancer Chat Canada. Participants join the group 
      discussion using text in real time. However, therapist leaders report some 
      challenges leading text-based online support groups in the absence of visual cues, 
      particularly in tracking participant distress. With multiple participants typing at 
      the same time, the nuances of the text messages or red flags for distress can 
      sometimes be missed. Recent advances in artificial intelligence such as deep 
      learning-based natural language processing offer potential solutions. This 
      technology can be used to analyze online support group text data to track 
      participants' expressed emotional distress, including fear, sadness, and 
      hopelessness. Artificial intelligence allows session activities to be monitored in 
      real time and alerts the therapist to participant disengagement. OBJECTIVE: We aim 
      to develop and evaluate an artificial intelligence-based cofacilitator prototype to 
      track and monitor online support group participants' distress through real-time 
      analysis of text-based messages posted during synchronous sessions. METHODS: An 
      artificial intelligence-based cofacilitator will be developed to identify 
      participants who are at-risk for increased emotional distress and track participant 
      engagement and in-session group cohesion levels, providing real-time alerts for 
      therapist to follow-up; generate postsession participant profiles that contain 
      discussion content keywords and emotion profiles for each session; and automatically 
      suggest tailored resources to participants according to their needs. The study is 
      designed to be conducted in 4 phases consisting of (1) development based on a subset 
      of data and an existing natural language processing framework, (2) performance 
      evaluation using human scoring, (3) beta testing, and (4) user experience 
      evaluation. RESULTS: This study received ethics approval in August 2019. Phase 1, 
      development of an artificial intelligence-based cofacilitator, was completed in 
      January 2020. As of December 2020, phase 2 is underway. The study is expected to be 
      completed by September 2021. CONCLUSIONS: An artificial intelligence-based 
      cofacilitator offers a promising new mode of delivery of person-centered online 
      support groups tailored to individual needs. INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT

AB  - The disposal of untreated sanitary sewage in the soil has several consequences for 
      human health and leads to environmental risks; thus, it is necessary investigating, 
      monitoring and remediating the affected sites. The aims of the current study are to 
      evaluate ecotoxicological effects on Eisenia andrei earthworms exposed to soil 
      subjected to sources of sanitary sewage discharge and to investigate whether 
      prevention values established by the Brazilian legislation for soil quality, 
      associated with the incidence of chemical substances in it, are satisfactory enough 
      to assure the necessary quality for different organisms. Earthworms' behavior, 
      reproduction, acetylcholinesterase activity, catalase, superoxide dismutase and 
      malondialdehyde levels were evaluated. The reproduction and behavior of earthworms 
      exposed to sanitary sewage were adversely affected. Increased superoxide dismutase 
      and catalase activity acted as antioxidant defense mechanism. Significantly 
      increased lipid peroxidation levels and acetylcholinesterase activity inhibition 
      have indicated lipid peroxidation in cell membrane and neurotransmission changes, 
      respectively. Results have confirmed that sanitary sewage induced oxidative stress 
      in earthworms. In addition, based on biochemical data analysis, the integrated 
      biomarker response (IBR) has evidenced different toxicity levels in earthworms 
      between the investigated points. Finally, results have indicated that effluents 
      released into the soil, without proper treatment, lead to contaminant accumulation 
      due to soil saturation and it can hinder different processes and biological 
      development taking place in the soil. In addition, the current study has shown that 
      physical-chemical analyses alone are not enough to assess soil quality, since it is 
      also requires adopting an ecotoxicological approach. Brazilian legislation focused 
      on soil quality must be revised and new guiding values must be proposed.

AB  - Wastewater reclamation and reuse have been practically applied to water-stressed 
      regions, but waterborne pathogens remaining in insufficiently treated wastewater are 
      of concern. Sanitation Safety Planning adopts the hazard analysis and critical 
      control point (HACCP) approach to manage human health risks upon exposure to 
      reclaimed wastewater. HACCP requires a predetermined reference value (critical 
      limit: CL) at critical control points (CCPs), in which specific parameters are 
      monitored and recorded in real time. A disinfection reactor of a wastewater 
      treatment plant (WWTP) is regarded as a CCP, and one of the CCP parameters is the 
      disinfection intensity (e.g., initial disinfectant concentration and contact time), 
      which is proportional to the log reduction value (LRV) of waterborne pathogens. 
      However, the achievable LRVs are not always stable because the disinfection 
      intensity is affected by water quality parameters, which vary among WWTPs. In this 
      study, we established models for projecting virus LRVs using ozone, in which water 
      quality and operational parameters were used as explanatory variables. For the model 
      construction, we used five machine learning algorithms and found that automatic 
      relevance determination with interaction terms resulted in better prediction 
      performances for norovirus and rotavirus LRVs. Poliovirus and coxsackievirus LRVs 
      were predicted well by a Bayesian ridge with interaction terms and lasso with 
      quadratic terms, respectively. The established models were relatively robust to 
      predict LRV using new datasets that were out of the range of the training data used 
      here, but it is important to collect LRV datasets further to make the models more 
      predictable and flexible for newly obtained datasets. The modeling framework 
      proposed here can help WWTP operators and risk assessors determine the appropriate 
      CL to protect human health in wastewater reclamation and reuse.

TI  - Which teachers are most at risk for voice disorders? Individual factors predicting 
      vocal acoustic parameters monitored in situ during a workweek.
LID - 10.1007/s00420-021-01681-3 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To identify the factors affecting teachers' vocal acoustic parameters, with 
      the aim of detecting individuals at risk of phonotrauma. METHOD: The voicing time, 
      voice sound pressure level [SPL] and fundamental frequency [f(o)] of 87 teachers 
      were measured during one workweek using a voice dosimeter. We retrospectively 
      investigated the impact of 10 factors (gender, age, teaching experience, teaching 
      level, tobacco, gastro-esophageal problems, nonoccupational voice activity, voice 
      education, past voice problems, and biopsychosocial impact of voice problems 
      measured using the Voice Handicap Index [VHI]) on each voice parameter. RESULTS: 
      None of the above factors affected voicing time or SPL. f(o) depended significantly 
      on gender, teaching level, nonoccupational voice activity and VHI score. 
      Specifically, f(o) was higher in women (Δ = 69 Hz), in individuals without 
      nonoccupational voice activities (Δ = 11 Hz), and in individuals with a lower VHI 
      score (increase of 0.7 Hz for each additional point). For females, post hoc 
      comparisons revealed a substantial impact of teaching level on f(o): university 
      instructors had deeper voices than kindergarten (Δ = 66 Hz), elementary (Δ = 52 Hz), 
      or secondary teachers (Δ = 41 Hz). CONCLUSIONS: Since higher f(o) increases the 
      mechanical stress related to vocal fold vibration, the screening and prevention of 
      phonotrauma should focus primarily on women, particularly those who teach at lower 
      levels, and teachers with more self-rated voice problems. The lower f(o) of teachers 
      who engage in nonprofessional voice activities may suggest acute inflammation or 
      muscle fatigue due to voice overload.

TI  - Variation in Phenolic Chemistry in Zostera marina Seagrass Along Environmental 
      Gradients.
LID - 10.3390/plants10020334 [doi]
LID - 334
AB  - Chemical ecology has been suggested as a less time-consuming and more cost-efficient 
      monitoring tool of seagrass ecosystems than traditional methods. Phenolic chemistry 
      in Zostera marina samples was analyzed against latitude, sea depth, sample position 
      within a seagrass meadow (periphery or center) and wave exposure. Multivariate data 
      analysis showed that rosmarinic acid correlated moderately positively with depth, 
      while the flavonoids had an overall strong negative correlation with increasing 
      depth-possibly reflecting lack of stress-induced conditions with increasing depth, 
      rather than a different response to light conditions. At a molecular level, the 
      flavonoids were separated into two groups; one group is well described by the 
      variables of depth and wave exposure, and the other group that was not well 
      described by these variables-the latter may reflect biosynthetic dependencies or 
      other unrevealed factors. A higher flavonoid/rosmarinic acid ratio was seen in the 
      periphery of a seagrass meadow, while the contrary ratio was seen in the center. 
      This may reflect higher plant stress in the periphery of a meadow, and the 
      flavonoid/rosmarinic acid ratio may provide a possible molecular index of seagrass 
      ecosystem health. Further studies are needed before the full potential of using 
      variation in phenolic chemistry as a seagrass ecosystem monitoring tool is 
      established.

      Psychological Responses to the COVID-19 Pandemic: Content Analysis of Text Messages.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The novel COVID-19 disease has negatively impacted mortality, economic 
      conditions, and mental health. These impacts are likely to continue after the 
      COVID-19 pandemic ends. There are no methods for characterizing the mental health 
      burden of the COVID-19 pandemic, and differentiating this burden from that of the 
      prepandemic era. Accurate illness detection methods are critical for facilitating 
      pandemic-related treatment and preventing the worsening of symptoms. OBJECTIVE: We 
      aimed to identify major themes and symptom clusters in the SMS text messages that 
      patients send to therapists. We assessed patients who were seeking treatment for 
      pandemic-related distress on Talkspace, which is a popular telemental health 
      platform. METHODS: We used a machine learning algorithm to identify patients' 
      pandemic-related concerns, based on their SMS text messages in a large, digital 
      mental health service platform (ie, Talkspace). This platform uses natural language 
      processing methods to analyze unstructured therapy transcript data, in parallel with 
      brief clinical assessment methods for analyzing depression and anxiety symptoms. 
      RESULTS: Our results show a significant increase in the incidence of 
      COVID-19-related intake anxiety symptoms (P<.001), but no significant differences in 
      the incidence of intake depression symptoms (P=.79). During our transcript analyses, 
      we identified terms that were related to 24 symptoms outside of those included in 
      the diagnostic criteria for anxiety and depression. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings for 
      Talkspace suggest that people who seek treatment during the pandemic experience more 
      severe intake anxiety than they did before the COVID-19 outbreak. It is important to 
      monitor the symptoms that we identified in this study and the symptoms of anxiety 
      and depression, to fully understand the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental 
      health.

AB  - Emotion plays a significant role in interpersonal communication and also improving 
      social life. In recent years, facial emotion recognition is highly adopted in 
      developing human-computer interfaces (HCI) and humanoid robots. In this work, a 
      triangulation method for extracting a novel set of geometric features is proposed to 
      classify six emotional expressions (sadness, anger, fear, surprise, disgust, and 
      happiness) using computer-generated markers. The subject's face is recognized by 
      using Haar-like features. A mathematical model has been applied to positions of 
      eight virtual markers in a defined location on the subject's face in an automated 
      way. Five triangles are formed by manipulating eight markers' positions as an edge 
      of each triangle. Later, these eight markers are uninterruptedly tracked by Lucas- 
      Kanade optical flow algorithm while subjects' articulating facial expressions. The 
      movement of the markers during facial expression directly changes the property of 
      each triangle. The area of the triangle (AoT), Inscribed circle circumference (ICC), 
      and the Inscribed circle area of a triangle (ICAT) are extracted as features to 
      classify the facial emotions. These features are used to distinguish six different 
      facial emotions using various types of machine learning algorithms. The inscribed 
      circle area of the triangle (ICAT) feature gives a maximum mean classification rate 
      of 98.17% using a Random Forest (RF) classifier compared to other features and 
      classifiers in distinguishing emotional expressions.

AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common psychiatric disorder and the leading 
      cause of disability worldwide. However, current methods used to diagnose depression 
      mainly rely on clinical interviews and self-reported scales of depressive symptoms, 
      which lack objectivity and efficiency. To address this challenge, we present a 
      machine learning approach to screen for MDD using electrodermal activity (EDA). 
      Participants included 30 patients with MDD and 37 healthy controls. Their EDA was 
      measured during five experimental phases consisted of baseline, mental arithmetic 
      task, recovery from the stress task, relaxation task, and recovery from the 
      relaxation task, which elicited multiple alterations in autonomic activity. Selected 
      EDA features were extracted from each phase, and differential EDA features between 
      two distinct phases were evaluated. By using these features as input data and 
      performing feature selection with SVM-RFE, 74% accuracy, 74% sensitivity, and 71% 
      specificity could be achieved by our decision tree classifier. The most relevant 
      features selected by SVM-RFE included differential EDA features and features from 
      the stress and relaxation tasks. These findings suggest that automatic detection of 
      depression based on EDA features is feasible and that monitoring changes in 
      physiological signal when a subject is experiencing autonomic arousal and recovery 
      may enhance discrimination power.

AB  - BACKGROUND: As a part of the European Union Naval Force - Mediterranean Operation 
      Sophia (EUNAVFOR Med), the Federal Republic of Germany is contributing to avoid 
      further loss of lives at sea by supplying two naval vessels. In the study presented 
      here we analyse the medical requirements of such rescue missions, as well as the 
      potential benefits of various additional monitoring devices in identifying 
      sick/injured refugees within the primary onboard medical assessment process. 
      METHODS: Retrospective analysis of the data collected between May - September 2015 
      from a German Naval Force frigate. Initial data collection focused on the primary 
      medical assessment and treatment process of refugees rescued from distress at sea. 
      Descriptive statistics, uni- and multivariate analysis were performed. The study has 
      received a positive vote from the Ethics Commission of the University of Ulm, 
      Germany (request no. 284/15) and has been registered in the German Register of 
      Clinical Studies (no. DRKS00009535). RESULTS: A total of 2656 refugees had been 
      rescued. 16.9 % of them were classified as "medical treatment required" within the 
      initial onboard medical assessment process. In addition to the clinical assessment 
      by an emergency physician, pulse rate (PR), core body temperature (CBT) and oxygen 
      saturation (SpO2) were evaluated. Sick/injured refugees displayed a statistically 
      significant higher PR (114/min vs. 107/min; p < .001) and CBT (37.1 °C vs. 36.7 °C; 
      p < .001). There was no statistically significant difference in SpO2-values. The 
      same results were found for the subgroup of patients classified as "treatment at 
      emergency hospital required". However, a much larger difference of the mean PR and 
      CBT (35/min resp. 1.8 °C) was found when examining the subgroups of the 
      corresponding refugee boats. A cut-off value of clinical importance could not be 
      found. Predominant diagnoses have been dermatological diseases (55.4), followed by 
      internal diseases (27.7) and trauma (12.1 %). None of the refugees classified as 
      "healthy" within the primary medical assessment process changed to "medical 
      treatment required" during further observation. CONCLUSIONS: The initial medical 
      assessment by an emergency physician has proved successful. PR, CBT and SpO2 didn't 
      have any clinical impact to improve the identification of sick/injured refugees 
      within the primary onboard assessment process.

AB  - The negative impact of conventional farming on environment and human health make 
      improvements on farming management mandatory. Imaging techniques are implemented in 
      remote sensing for monitoring crop fields and plant phenotyping programs. The 
      increasingly large size and complexity of the data obtained by these techniques, 
      makes the implementation of powerful mathematical tools necessary in order to 
      identify informative parameters and to apply them in precision agriculture. 
      Multicolor fluorescence imaging is a useful approach for the study of plant defense 
      responses to stress factors at bench scale. However, it has not been fully applied 
      to plant phenotyping. This work evaluates the possible application of multicolor 
      fluorescence imaging in combination with thermography for the particular case of 
      zucchini plants affected by soft-rot, caused by Dickeya dadantii. Several 
      statistical models -based on logistic regression analysis (LRA) and artificial 
      neural networks (ANN)- were obtained for the experimental system zucchini-D. 
      dadantii, which classify new samples as "healthy" or "infected." The LRA worked best 
      in identifying high dose-infiltrated leaves (in infiltrated and non-infiltrated 
      areas) whereas ANN offered a higher accuracy at identifying low dose-infiltrated 
      areas. To assess the applicability of these results to cucurbits in a more general 
      way, these models were validated for melon infected by the same pathogen, achieving 
      accurate predictions for the infiltrated areas. The values of accuracy achieved are 
      comparable to those found in the literature for classifiers identifying other 
      infections based on data obtained by different techniques. Thus, MCFI in combination 
      with thermography prove useful at providing data at lab scale that can be analyzed 
      by machine learning. This approach could be scaled up to be applied in plant 
      phenotyping.

      method enriching for coverage of cytosine positions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cytosine methylation in plant genomes is important for the regulation of 
      gene transcription and transposon activity. Genome-wide methylomes are studied upon 
      mutation of the DNA methyltransferases, adaptation to environmental stresses or 
      during development. However, from basic biology to breeding programs, there is a 
      need to monitor multiple samples to determine transgenerational methylation 
      inheritance or differential cytosine methylation. Methylome data obtained by sodium 
      hydrogen sulfite (bisulfite)-conversion and next-generation sequencing (NGS) provide 
      genome-wide information on cytosine methylation. However, a profiling method that 
      detects cytosine methylation state dispersed over the genome would allow 
      high-throughput analysis of multiple plant samples with distinct epigenetic 
      signatures. We use specific restriction endonucleases to enrich for cytosine 
      coverage in a bisulfite and NGS-based profiling method, which was compared to 
      whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of the same plant material. METHODS: We 
      established an effective methylome profiling method in plants, termed plant-reduced 
      representation bisulfite sequencing (plant-RRBS), using optimized double restriction 
      endonuclease digestion, fragment end repair, adapter ligation, followed by bisulfite 
      conversion, PCR amplification and NGS. We report a performant laboratory protocol 
      and a straightforward bioinformatics data analysis pipeline for plant-RRBS, 
      applicable for any reference-sequenced plant species. RESULTS: As a proof of 
      concept, methylome profiling was performed using an Oryza sativa ssp. indica pure 
      breeding line and a derived epigenetically altered line (epiline). Plant-RRBS 
      detects methylation levels at tens of millions of cytosine positions deduced from 
      bisulfite conversion in multiple samples. To evaluate the method, the coverage of 
      cytosine positions, the intra-line similarity and the differential cytosine 
      methylation levels between the pure breeding line and the epiline were determined. 
      Plant-RRBS reproducibly covers commonly up to one fourth of the cytosine positions 
      in the rice genome when using MspI-DpnII within a group of five biological 
      replicates of a line. The method predominantly detects cytosine methylation in 
      putative promoter regions and not-annotated regions in rice. CONCLUSIONS: Plant-RRBS 
      offers high-throughput and broad, genome-dispersed methylation detection by 
      effective read number generation obtained from reproducibly covered genome fractions 
      using optimized endonuclease combinations, facilitating comparative analyses of 
      multi-sample studies for cytosine methylation and transgenerational stability in 
      experimental material and plant breeding populations.

AB  - The ratio of early diastolic trans-mitral flow velocity to tissue-Doppler mitral 
      annular early diastolic velocity (E/e'), and left ventricular end-diastolic 
      pressure(LVEDP) have been shown to be correlated at rest, provided that patients are 
      not on positive inotropic drugs. Data concerning the latter correlation during 
      exercise stress are conflicting. Therefore, we investigated if use of negative 
      inotropic drugs (NID), impacts the accuracy of E/e' as a surrogate for LVEDP during 
      low-level exercise. An exercise(50 watts) during cardiac invasive hemodynamic 
      monitoring and an exercise echocardiography were performed prospectively within 
      24 hours in 54 patients (81%male, 62 ± 9years) with preserved LV Ejection-Fraction. 
      Before exercise, the patients had scattered LVEDP (13.8 ± 5.8 mmHg) and septal E/e' 
      (8.7 ± 2.7). Half of them were on NID, mainly betablockers(n = 26). The correlation 
      between septal-E/e' and LVEDP was low for examinations performed at rest 
      (r = 0.35,p = 0.01) with no significant impact of NID. For measurements performed at 
      50 Watts, NID had a significant impact on the association between 
      septal-E/e'50 watts and LVEDP50 watts (β = -0.28,p = 0.03). Correlation between 
      septal-E/e'50 watts and LVEDP50 watts persisted in patients on NID 
      (r = 0.61,p = 0.001) while it disappeared in the group of patients with no NID 
      (r = 0.15,p = 0.47). NID use is an important confounding factor to take into 
      consideration when assessing exercise LVFP using stress E/e' in patients with 
      preserved LVEF.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) in children results in a high number of 
      emergency department visits and risk for long-term adverse effects. OBJECTIVES: To 
      estimate lifetime prevalence of TBI in a nationally representative sample of US 
      children and describe the association between TBI and other childhood health 
      conditions. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Data were analyzed from the 2011-2012 
      National Survey of Children's Health, a cross-sectional telephone survey of US 
      households with a response rate of 23%. Traumatic brain injury prevalence estimates 
      were stratified by sociodemographic characteristics. The likelihood of reporting 
      specific health conditions was compared between children with and without TBI. 
      Age-adjusted prevalence estimates were computed for each state. Associations between 
      TBI prevalence, insurance type, and parent rating of insurance adequacy were 
      examined. Data analysis was conducted from February 1, 2016, through November 1, 
      2017. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Lifetime estimate of TBI in children, associated 
      childhood health conditions, and parent report of health insurance type and 
      adequacy. RESULTS: The lifetime estimate of parent-reported TBI among children was 
      2.5% (95% CI, 2.3%-2.7%), representing over 1.8 million children nationally. 
      Children with a lifetime history of TBI were more likely to have a variety of health 
      conditions compared with those without a TBI history. Those with the highest 
      prevalence included learning disorders (21.4%; 95% CI, 18.1%-25.2%); 
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (20.5%; 95% CI, 17.4%-24.0%); 
      speech/language problems (18.6%; 95% CI, 15.8%-21.7%); developmental delay (15.3%; 
      95% CI, 12.9%-18.1%); bone, joint, or muscle problems (14.2%; 95% CI, 11.6%-17.2%); 
      and anxiety problems (13.2%; 95% CI, 11.0%-16.0%). States with a higher prevalence 
      of childhood TBI were more likely to have a higher proportion of children with 
      private health insurance and higher parent report of adequate insurance. Examples of 
      states with higher prevalence of TBI and higher proportion of private insurance 
      included Maine, Vermont, Pennsylvania, Washington, Montana, Wyoming North Dakota, 
      South Dakota, and Colorado. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A large number of US children 
      have experienced a TBI during childhood. Higher TBI prevalence in states with 
      greater levels of private insurance and insurance adequacy may suggest an 
      underrecognition of TBI among children with less access to care. For more 
      comprehensive monitoring, health care professionals should be aware of the increased 
      risk of associated health conditions among children with TBI.

TI  - Family members' experiences in adult intensive care units: a systematic review.
PG  - 569-581
LID - 10.1111/scs.12675 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Admission to Intensive Care Units (ICU) exposures family members to a 
      new environment, advanced monitoring systems and aggressive treatments. This is 
      coupled with the critical condition of the patient being admitted in ICU. In such 
      times of stress and crisis, families have varying experiences as they navigate the 
      ICU journey. These happen more or less in chronological phases. AIM: This review 
      sought to describe the experiences of family members of patients admitted in adult 
      ICUs. DATA SOURCES: Four electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Scopus and Web of 
      Science) were searched, using keywords and free-text words. METHODS: Curation of the 
      review question involved problem identification, a scoping search, developing a 
      search strategy, evaluation, data analysis, and reporting. Freehand search in 
      reference lists of eligible articles was also done to obtain potentially eligible 
      articles published in English language between 2007 and 2018. Studies were included 
      if they reported on family members' experiences in adult ICUs. This review conforms 
      to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA). 
      RESULTS: Upon completion of the screening process, 28 studies were included. Most 
      studies were conducted in the United States while no study was identified from 
      Africa. We report on 717 family members. Family members' experience of the ICU 
      journey falls into three main themes: (i) Floating, (ii) Probing and (iii) 
      Continuity or Closure. CONCLUSION: As healthcare technology advances, the ICU 
      environment consequently needs to evolve. As such, healthcare providers will need to 
      adjust their practice, support and consider the patients' family as the other part 
      of the patient and members of the care team in order to meet their expectations. 
      Further research highlighting family members' experience of the ICU journey in 
      Africa is needed.

TI  - Seeking harmony in the provision of care to the stroke-impaired: views of Chinese 
      family caregivers.
PG  - 1436-44
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2702.2010.03500.x [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To explore the coping strategies of Chinese family caregivers of 
      stroke-impaired older relatives. BACKGROUND: Many stroke-impaired patients rely 
      heavily on support from their families, and the daily lives of such family 
      caregivers are severely impacted. However, services and support for family 
      caregivers of stroke-impaired relatives in the home setting have received little 
      attention. Appropriate and relevant information and support to family caregivers are 
      important in facilitating the care-giving task. It is, therefore, necessary to 
      understand the nature and demands of care-giving before planning specific 
      educational and support programmes. DESIGN: Grounded theory. METHODS: Fifteen 
      Chinese family caregivers of stroke-impaired older relatives were recruited and 
      interviewed in 2003 and 2004. Theoretical sampling and constant comparative analysis 
      were used to recruit the sample and perform data analysis. RESULTS: Seeking harmony 
      to provide care for the stroke-impaired was the core category for describing and 
      guiding the family care-giving process, with five main stages: (1) living with 
      ambiguity, (2) monitoring the recovery progress, (3) accepting the downfalls, (4) 
      meeting family obligations and (5) reconciling with harmony. These issues were 
      seldom discussed openly with health professionals. CONCLUSIONS: The findings 
      indicated that Chinese family caregivers determine their own needs by seeking 
      harmony to continue to provide care without thinking about getting help from others 
      or their own health problems. These findings help to define some of the complex 
      dynamics that have an impact on the development of partnership care and might 
      challenge nurses practising in the community. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: 
      Community nurses should assess and understand the coping strategies of family 
      caregivers and assist them to engage in stress-reducing practices. This is an 
      important partnership to be formed in stroke care for family caregivers in the 
      community. The study findings will guide further development of family care-giving 
      aspects in nursing practice.

TI  - Recognizing Emotional Expression as an Outcome Measure After Face Transplant.
PG  - e1919247
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2019.19247 [doi]
LID - e1919247
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Limited quantitative data exist on the restoration of nonverbal 
      communication via facial emotional expression after face transplant. Objective and 
      noninvasive methods for measuring outcomes and tracking rehabilitation after face 
      transplant are lacking. OBJECTIVE: To measure emotional expression as an indicator 
      of functional outcomes and rehabilitation after face transplant via objective, 
      noninvasive, and nonobtrusive software-based video analysis. DESIGN, SETTING, AND 
      PARTICIPANTS: This single-center case-control study analyzed videos with 
      commercially available video analysis software capable of detecting emotional 
      expression. The study participants were 6 patients who underwent face transplant at 
      Brigham and Women's Hospital between April 2009 and March 2014. They were matched by 
      age, race/ethnicity, culture, and sex to 6 healthy controls with no prior facial 
      surgical procedures. Participants were asked to perform either emotional expressions 
      (direct evaluation) or standardized facial movements (indirect evaluation). Videos 
      were obtained in a clinical setting, except for direct evaluation videos of 3 
      patients that were recorded at the patients' residences. Data analysis was performed 
      from June 2018 to November 2018. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The possibility of 
      detecting the emotional expressions of happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, 
      and disgust was evaluated using intensity score values between 0 and 1, representing 
      expressions that are absent or fully present, respectively. RESULTS: Six patients 
      underwent face transplant (4 men; mean [SD] age, 42 [14] years). Four underwent full 
      face transplants, and 2 underwent partial face transplants of the middle and lower 
      two-thirds of the face. In healthy controls, happiness was the only emotion reliably 
      recognized in both indirect (mean [SD] intensity score, 0.92 [0.05]) and direct 
      (mean [SD] intensity score, 0.91 [0.04]) evaluation. Indirect evaluation showed that 
      expression of happiness significantly improved 1 year after transplant (0.04 point 
      per year; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.06 point per year; P = .002). Expression of happiness 
      was restored to a mean of 43% (range, 14% to 75%) of that of healthy controls after 
      face transplant. The expression of sadness showed a significant change only during 
      the first year after transplant (-0.53 point per year; 95% CI, -0.82 to -0.24 point 
      per year; P = .005). All other emotions were detectable with no significant change 
      after transplant. Nearly all emotions were detectable in long-term direct evaluation 
      of 3 patients, with expression of happiness restored to a mean of 26% (range, 5% to 
      59%) of that of healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Partial restoration of 
      facial emotional expression is possible after face transplant. Video analysis 
      software may provide useful clinical information and aid rehabilitation after face 
      transplant.

TI  - Virtual Reality-Based Treatment for Military Members and Veterans With 
      Combat-Related Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: Protocol for a Multimodular 
      Motion-Assisted Memory Desensitization and Reconsolidation Randomized Controlled 
      Trial.
PG  - e20620
LID - 10.2196/20620 [doi]
LID - e20620
AB  - BACKGROUND: Military members are at elevated risk of operational stress injuries, 
      including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and moral injury. Although 
      psychotherapy can reduce symptoms, some military members may experience 
      treatment-resistant PTSD. Multimodular motion-assisted memory desensitization and 
      reconsolidation (3MDR) has been introduced as a virtual reality (VR) intervention 
      for military members with PTSD related to military service. The 3MDR intervention 
      incorporates exposure therapy, psychotherapy, eye movement desensitization and 
      reconsolidation, VR, supportive counselling, and treadmill walking. OBJECTIVE: The 
      objective of this study is to investigate whether 3MDR reduces PTSD symptoms among 
      military members with combat-related treatment-resistant PTSD (TR-PTSD); examine the 
      technology acceptance and usability of the Computer Assisted Rehabilitation 
      ENvironment (CAREN) and 3MDR interventions by Canadian Armed Forces service members 
      (CAF-SMs), veterans, 3MDR clinicians, and operators; and evaluate the impact on 
      clinicians and operators of delivering 3MDR. METHODS: This is a mixed-methods 
      waitlist controlled crossover design randomized controlled trial. Participants 
      include both CAF-SMs and veterans (N=40) aged 18-60 years with combat-related 
      TR-PTSD (unsuccessful experience of at least 2 evidence-based trauma treatments). 
      Participants will also include clinicians and operators (N=12) who have been trained 
      in 3MDR and subsequently utilized this intervention with patients. CAF-SMs and 
      veterans will receive 6 weekly 90-minute 3MDR sessions. Quantitative and qualitative 
      data will be collected at baseline and at 1, 3, and 6 months postintervention. 
      Quantitative data collection will include multiomic biomarkers (ie, blood and 
      salivary proteomic and genomic profiles of neuroendocrine, immune-inflammatory 
      mediators, and microRNA), eye tracking, electroencephalography, and physiological 
      data. Data from outcome measures will capture self-reported symptoms of PTSD, moral 
      injury, resilience, and technology acceptance and usability. Qualitative data will 
      be collected from audiovisual recordings of 3MDR sessions and semistructured 
      interviews. Data analysis will include univariate and multivariate approaches, and 
      thematic analysis of treatment sessions and interviews. Machine learning analysis 
      will be included to develop models for the prediction of diagnosis, symptom 
      severity, and treatment outcomes. RESULTS: This study commenced in April 2019 and is 
      planned to conclude in April 2021. Study results will guide the further evolution 
      and utilization of 3MDR for military members with TR-PTSD and will have utility in 
      treating other trauma-affected populations. CONCLUSIONS: The goal of this study is 
      to utilize qualitative and quantitative primary and secondary outcomes to provide 
      evidence for the effectiveness and feasibility of 3MDR for treating CAF-SMs and 
      veterans with combat-related TR-PTSD. The results will inform a full-scale clinical 
      trial and stimulate development and adaptation of the protocol to mobile VR apps in 
      supervised clinical settings. This study will add to knowledge of the clinical 
      effectiveness of 3MDR, and provide the first comprehensive analysis of biomarkers, 
      technology acceptance and usability, moral injury, resilience, and the experience of 
      clinicians and operators delivering 3MDR. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN Registry

TI  - Effect of a Skin Self-monitoring Smartphone Application on Time to Physician 
      Consultation Among Patients With Possible Melanoma: A Phase 2 Randomized Clinical 
      Trial.
PG  - e200001
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.0001 [doi]
LID - e200001
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Melanoma is among the most lethal skin cancers; it has become the fifth 
      most common cancer in the United Kingdom, and incidence rates are rising. Population 
      approaches to reducing incidence have focused on mass media campaigns to promote 
      earlier presentation and potentially improve melanoma outcomes; however, 
      interventions using smartphone applications targeting those with the greatest risk 
      could promote earlier presentation to health care professionals for individuals with 
      new or changing skin lesions. OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of a commercially 
      available skin self-monitoring (SSM) smartphone application among individuals with 
      increased risk of melanoma on their decision to seek help for changing skin lesions. 
      DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This phase 2 randomized clinical trial was 
      conducted in 12 family practices in Eastern England between 2016 and 2017. A total 
      of 238 participants, aged 18 to 75 years and with an increased risk of melanoma, 
      were identified using a real-time melanoma risk assessment tool in family practice 
      waiting rooms. Analysis was intention to treat. Participants were observed for 12 
      months, and data analysis was conducted from January to August 2018. INTERVENTION: 
      The intervention and control groups received a consultation with standard written 
      advice on sun protection and skin cancer detection. The intervention group had an 
      SSM application loaded on their smartphone and received instructions for use and 
      monthly self-monitoring reminders. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The coprimary 
      outcomes were skin consultation rates with family practice physicians and patient 
      intervals, measured as the time between noticing a skin change and consulting with a 
      family practice clinician. Follow-up questionnaires were sent at 6 and 12 months, 
      and consultation rates were extracted from family practice records. Secondary 
      outcomes included skin self-examination benefits and barriers, self-efficacy for 
      consulting without delay, perceived melanoma risk, sun protection habits, and 
      potential harms. RESULTS: A total of 238 patients were randomized (median 
      [interquartile range] age, 55 [43-65] years, 131 [55.0%] women, 227 [95.4%] white 
      British; 119 [50.0%] randomized to the intervention group). Overall, 51 participants 
      (21.4%) had consultations regarding skin changes during the 12 months of follow-up, 
      and 157 participants (66.0%) responded to at least 1 follow-up questionnaire. There 
      were no significant differences in skin consultation rates (adjusted risk ratio, 
      0.96; 95% CI, 0.56 to 1.66; P = .89), measures of SSM (adjusted mean difference, 
      0.08; 95% CI, -0.83 to 1.00; P = .86), or psychological harm (eg, Melanoma Worry 
      Scale: adjusted mean difference, -0.12; 95% CI, -0.56 to 0.31; P = .58). CONCLUSIONS 
      AND RELEVANCE: In this study, recruitment, retention, and initial delivery of the 
      intervention were feasible, and this research provided no evidence of harm from the 
      SSM smartphone application. However, no evidence of benefit on skin self-examination 
      or health care consulting was found, and there is no reason at this stage to 
      recommend its implementation in this population at increased risk of melanoma. TRIAL

TI  - Therapeutic Drug Monitoring of Levoffoxacin in an Obese Adolescent: A Case Report.
PG  - 261-265
LID - 10.5863/1551-6776-25.3.261 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the pharmacokinetics of levofloxacin in an obese adolescent 
      patient in the pediatric intensive care unit. METHODS: A single-patient medical 
      record review was conducted. RESULTS: A 168-kg, 15-year-old female with past medical 
      history of Prader-Willi syndrome and asthma initially presented with respiratory 
      distress secondary to asthma exacerbation. She failed non-invasive ventilation and 
      was subsequently intubated for respiratory failure and progressed to high-frequency 
      oscillatory ventilation. On hospital day 1 (HD 1) an infectious workup was begun 
      because of a fever, worsening clinical status, and initiation of vasopressors and an 
      empiric antimicrobial regimen of cefepime and clindamycin. The urine culture 
      subsequently grew Escherichia coli and the respiratory culture grew Pseudomonas 
      aeruginosa. She continued to be febrile, which was thought to be due to an 
      intra-abdominal abscess. On HD 14, the antimicrobial regimen was changed to 
      levofloxacin because of continued fevers and no significant clinical improvement. 
      Levofloxacin was initiated at 1000 mg IV every 24 hours. Levofloxacin serum levels 
      were obtained at 0.5, 3.5, and 11.5 hours after infusion, which were 8.61, 5.76, and 
      2.7 mg/L, respectively. These concentrations translated into a peak level of 8.79 
      mg/L, a half-life of 6.4 hours, and an AUC of 80 mg·hr/L, which are discordant from 
      the expected peak of 16 mg/L, a half-life of 8 hours, and an AUC of 120 mg·hr/L. 
      Based on these values, the levofloxacin regimen was adjusted to 1000 mg IV every 12 
      hours, and repeat levels 0.5, 3.5, and 11.5 hours after infusion were 9.91, 6.56, 
      and 3.27 mg/L, respectively, corresponding to a peak of 10.5 mg/L, a half-life of 
      5.18 hours, and an AUC of 200 mg·hr/L. After the adjustment in levofloxacin regimen, 
      she became afebrile, WBC resolution and improvement in her overall clinical status, 
      and she received a total duration for levofloxacin of 21 days. CONCLUSION: A 
      levofloxacin regimen of 1000 mg IV every 12 hours was successful in providing for an 
      appropriate AUC exposure and was associated with a successful clinical outcome in 
      this morbidly obese adolescent.

LID - 10.1016/j.radi.2020.10.004 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Imaging is essential for the initial diagnosis and monitoring of the 
      novel coronavirus, which emerged in Wuhan, China. This study aims to assess the 
      insight of radiographers on how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected their work 
      routine and if protective measures are applied. METHOD: A prospective observational 
      study was conducted among radiographers registered in the Cyprus Society of 
      Registered Radiologic Technologists & Radiation Therapy Technologists. A 
      questionnaire composed of 28 multiple choice questions was utilised, and the data 
      analysis was performed using SPSS software with the statistical significance assumed 
      as p-value < 0.05. RESULTS: Out of 350 registered radiographers, 101 responses were 
      received. The results showed that there are statistically significant differences 
      regarding the working hours, the feeling of stress, the work effectiveness, the 
      average examination time, the presence of a protocol used among the different 
      workplaces of the participants; a private radiology centre, a private hospital or a 
      public hospital, with a p-value 0.0022, 0.015, 0.027, 0.001, 0.0001 respectively. 
      Also, statistically significant differences were observed in the decontamination 
      methods used for equipment (p-value 0.007), for air (p-value 0.04) and when 
      decontamination takes place (p-value 0.00032) among the different workplaces of the 
      participants. Nonetheless, the majority of radiographers believe that their 
      workplace is sufficiently provided with PPE, cleaning supplies, equipment, and with 
      cleaning personnel and are optimistic regarding the adequacy of these provisions in 
      the next three months. CONCLUSION: This study showed that in the Republic of Cyprus, 
      there are protocols regarding protective measures against COVID-19, and the 
      radiographers are adequately trained on how to face an infectious disease outbreak. 
      However, work is needed in order to develop protocols that reassure the safety of 
      patients and medical personnel while managing the excess workload effectively. 
      IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This study indicates the importance of applying 
      protective measures and protocols in the radiology departments in order to minimise 
      the spread of the virus.

AB  - BACKGROUND: With the rapid development of information technology and mobile devices, 
      an increasing number of mobile medical services and platforms have emerged. However, 
      China's current mental health situation necessitates further discussion and research 
      on how to provide more patient-centered services in the face of many challenges and 
      opportunities. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the attitudes and preferences 
      of mental health service stakeholders regarding mobile mental health services and 
      discuss the challenges and opportunities faced by mobile technology developers in 
      China. METHODS: A web-based survey was conducted by following the Checklist for 
      Reporting Results of Internet E-Surveys (CHERRIES) checklist. A total of 586 valid 
      questionnaires were collected. Respondents included 184 patients or their family 
      members, 225 mental health professionals, and 177 people from the general 
      population. Data analysis was completed using SPSS 24.0. RESULTS: Among the various 
      problems perceived regarding the current mental health medical environment, 
      difficulty in finding appropriate psychologists and limited visit times ranked 
      highest. Social media (n=380/586, 64.9%) was the most preferred platform among all 
      participants, whereas professionals showed a higher preference for smartphone apps 
      (n=169/225, 75.1%). Professional instruction, psychological consultation, and mental 
      health education (ranked top 3) were the most commonly identified needs. Mental 
      health professionals generally emphasized more on treatment-related mobile mental 
      health service needs, especially medication reminders (χ(2)(2)=70.7; P<.001), 
      symptom monitoring (χ(2)(2)=24.0; P<.001), and access to mental health resources 
      (χ(2)(2)=38.6; P<.001). However, patients and their family members focused more on 
      convenient web-based prescriptions (χ(2)(2)=7.7; P=.02), with the general population 
      interested in web-based psychological consultation (χ(2)(2)=23.1; P<.001) and mental 
      health knowledge (χ(2)(2)=9.1; P=.01). Almost half of the participants regarded 
      mobile mental health services as highly acceptable or supported their use, but less 
      than 30% of participants thought mobile mental health services might be very 
      helpful. Concerns about mobile mental health mainly focused on information security. 
      Service receivers also suspected the quality and professionalism of content, and 
      mental health professionals were worried about time and energy consumption as well 
      as medical safety. CONCLUSIONS: In terms of service flow, mobile services could be 
      used to expand service time and improve efficiency before and after diagnosis. More 
      individualized mobile mental health service content in more acceptable forms should 
      be developed to meet the various needs of different mental health stakeholders. 
      Multidisciplinary training and communication could be incorporated to facilitate the 
      integration and cooperation of more well-rounded service teams. A standard medical 
      record system and data format would better promote the development of future 
      intelligent medical care. Issues such as ensuring service quality, solving safety 
      risks, and better integrating mobile services with regular medical workflows also 
      need to be addressed.

TI  - Suboptimal Temperature Acclimation Affects Kennedy Pathway Gene Expression, Lipidome 
      and Metabolite Profile of Nannochloropsis salina during PUFA Enriched TAG Synthesis.
LID - 10.3390/md16110425 [doi]
LID - 425
AB  - In humans, dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are involved in therapeutic 
      processes such as prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases, 
      neuropsychiatric disorders, and dementia. We examined the physiology, PUFA 
      accumulation and glycerol lipid biosynthesis in the marine microalga Nannochloropsis 
      salina in response to constant suboptimal temperature (<20 °C). As expected, N. 
      salina exhibited significantly reduced growth rate and photosynthetic activity 
      compared to optimal cultivation temperature. Total fatty acid contents were not 
      significantly elevated at reduced temperatures. Cultures grown at 5 °C had the 
      highest quantity of eicosapentanoic acid (EPA) (C20:5n3) and the lowest growth rate. 
      Additionally, we monitored broadband lipid composition to model the occurrence of 
      metabolic alteration and remodeling for various lipid pools. We focused on 
      triacylglycerol (TAG) with elevated PUFA content. TAGs with EPA at all three acyl 
      positions were higher at a cultivation temperature of 15 °C. Furthermore, 
      monogalactosyldiacylglycerol and digalactosyldiacylglycerol, which are polar lipids 
      associated with chloroplast membranes, decreased with reduced cultivation 
      temperatures. Moreover, gene expression analysis of key genes involved in Kennedy 
      pathway for de novo TAG biosynthesis revealed bimodal variations in transcript level 
      amongst the temperature treatments. Collectively, these results show that 
      Nannochloropsis salina is a promising source of PUFA containing lipids.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Lead is a toxic heavy metal, which causes irreversible damage in 
      children. Oxidative stress is the underlying mechanism of lead toxicity, and 
      monitoring oxidative stress of lead poisoning children in vivo is important. Our 
      study aimed to investigate blood serum levels of biochemical parameters, including 
      albumin, bilirubin, creatinine, and uric acid, which are regarded as non-enzymatic 
      antioxidants, in children with lead poisoning. METHODS: We studied 355 children with 
      lead poisoning and 355 age- and sex-matched controls. We analyzed clinical 
      characteristics and measured serum levels of total protein, globulin, albumin, 
      bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase, urea, and 
      creatinine. RESULTS: We found that albumin, bilirubin, urea, and creatinine levels 
      were significantly lower and AST, total protein, and globulin levels were higher in 
      children with lead poisoning than in controls. Direct bilirubin, albumin, total 
      protein, urea, creatinine, and AST levels were associated with lead poisoning after 
      adjustment for other covariates. Spearman analysis showed that direct bilirubin, 
      albumin, and urea levels were independent indicators (i.e., not related to 
      hemoglobin or weight), while creatinine levels showed a moderate correlation with 
      weight. CONCLUSION: Lead interferes with the non-enzymatic antioxidant system in 
      children, and lead poisoning results in a decrease in serum bilirubin levels.

TI  - Effect of reducing dietary advanced glycation end products on obesity-associated 
      complications: a systematic review.
PG  - 725-734
LID - 10.1093/nutrit/nuz034 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Consumption of dietary advanced glycation end products (AGEs) is associated 
      with oxidative stress, inflammation, and other chronic conditions commonly 
      associated with obesity. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the effects of dietary AGEs on 
      complications associated with obesity. DATA SOURCES: This systematic review was 
      conducted and reported according to PRISMA guidelines. The PubMed, Cochrane, and 
      Scopus databases were searched, using the terms "advanced glycation end products," 
      "overweight," and "obesity." The last search was performed in October 2018. DATA 
      EXTRACTION: Six studies that evaluated the effects of low-AGE and high-AGE diets 
      were included in the review. The duration of the studies ranged from 1 day to 
      12 weeks. A comparison of all the compiled data was conducted by the authors. DATA 
      ANALYSIS: Circulating and urinary AGE markers, besides soluble receptor for AGEs, 
      were considered as the primary outcomes. The secondary outcomes were 
      cardiometabolic, inflammatory, glycemic, anthropometric, and renal markers. 
      CONCLUSIONS: AGE-RAGE interactions can activate the NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa B) 
      signaling pathway and inhibit the PI3K-AKT pathway in adipocytes, which may explain 
      their association with chronic diseases. This interaction can be considered as a 
      novel explanation for the pathogenesis of obesity. AGEs can also be used as a 
      biomarker for monitoring responses to dietary interventions in overweight and obese 
      people. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO registration no. CRD42018082745.

TI  - The family transition experience when living with childhood neuromuscular disease: A 
      grounded theory study.
LID - 10.1111/jan.14754 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Neuromuscular diseases are rare conditions that present with progressive 
      muscular weakness. As affected children transition into adulthood, they become more 
      physically dependent on their families for support. There is little evidence on the 
      family transition experience, which this study explored to identify experiences, 
      challenges, and strategies of coping. DESIGN: Informed by family systems theory, a 
      constructivist grounded theory study was conducted (2014-2017). METHODS: Data were 
      collected by one-on-one interviews with a purposive sample of affected Swiss 
      individuals and their families from 2015 to 2016. Data analysis used coding, memo 
      writing, theoretical sampling, and constant comparison techniques. RESULTS: The 
      analysis of 31 interviews with 10 affected individuals and 21 family members 
      resulted in an interpretive theory constituted of four categories: (a) living with 
      physical dependence, while striving for independence; (b) balancing proximity; (c) 
      conforming and challenging social standards and expectations; and (d) grieving for 
      loss, while joining forces for life. CONCLUSION: Family functioning and well-being 
      were threatened by recurring tension from stress, physical and emotional 
      difficulties, strained relationships, and conflict. The families' strategies of 
      coping and adaptation and their relationships and communication shaped their 
      transition experience. IMPACT: Families that experience threats to their well-being 
      and functioning would benefit from: needs assessment and monitoring; planning of 
      appropriate family interventions; support of family relationships and communication, 
      effective coping, and mastery; and positive adaptation to change.

AB  - Microclimate change related events affect cities total environment and therefore 
      citizens' wellbeing. In a framework of urban resilience challenge, it is important 
      to guarantee thermally comfortable conditions to dwellers in outdoors but also to 
      preserve cultural heritage masterpieces for tourism and local socio-cultural 
      identity. This work couples an innovative field monitoring at multiple scales and a 
      validated numerical modelling effort to identify indoor and outdoor critical 
      conditions at the present time and in the future, according to IPCC climate change 
      forecast scenarios. The authors focused the attention on the overheating risk of 
      Gubbio historical city center, in central Italy. Experimental data analysis 
      highlights the microclimate granularity of the case study with detected temperature 
      discrepancies up to 2.5 °C observed at pedestrian height during the hottest hour, 
      i.e. 2p.m. Collected data are then used to validate the numerical models of (i) the 
      most significant building of the city and (ii) its surroundings to investigate 
      indoor/outdoor thermal comfort stress due to climate change and local overheating. 
      The combined analysis shows that indoor operative temperature reaches 32 °C on 
      average in 80 years, compared to the current 29 °C value. In the outdoors, apparent 
      temperature increases by about 10 °C on 2100, being responsible for a serious threat 
      compromising socio-cultural life, human health and outdoor and recreational 
      activities.

AB  - An In Vitro Comparative Immunogenicity Assessment (IVCIA) assay was evaluated as a 
      tool for predicting the potential relative immunogenicity of biotherapeutic 
      attributes. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from up to 50 healthy naïve human 
      donors were monitored up to 8 days for T-cell proliferation, the number of IL-2 or 
      IFN-γ secreting cells, and the concentration of a panel of secreted cytokines. The 
      response in the assay to 10 monoclonal antibodies was found to be in agreement with 
      the clinical immunogenicity, suggesting that the assay might be applied to 
      immunogenicity risk assessment of antibody biotherapeutic attributes. However, the 
      response in the assay is a measure of T-cell functional activity and the alignment 
      with clinical immunogenicity depends on several other factors. The assay was 
      sensitive to sequence variants and could differentiate single point mutations of the 
      same biotherapeutic. Nine mAbs that were highly aggregated by stirring induced a 
      higher response in the assay than the original mAbs before stirring stress, in a 
      manner that did not match the relative T-cell response of the original mAbs. In 
      contrast, mAbs that were glycated by different sugars (galactose, glucose, and 
      mannose) showed little to no increase in response in the assay above the response to 
      the original mAbs before glycation treatment. The assay was also used successfully 
      to assess similarity between multiple lots of the same mAb, both from the same 
      manufacturer and from different manufacturers (biosimilars). A strategy for using 
      the IVCIA assay for immunogenicity risk assessment during the entire lifespan 
      development of biopharmaceuticals is proposed.

AB  - Remote sensing (RS)-based models play an important role in estimating and monitoring 
      terrestrial ecosystem gross primary productivity (GPP). Several RS-based GPP models 
      have been developed using different criteria, yet the sensitivities to environmental 
      factors vary among models; thus, a comparison of model sensitivity is necessary for 
      analyzing and interpreting results and for choosing suitable models. In this study, 
      we globally evaluated and compared the sensitivities of 14 RS-based models (2 
      process-, 4 vegetation-index-, 5 light-use-efficiency, and 3 machine-learning-based 
      models) and benchmarked them against GPP responses to climatic factors measured at 
      flux sites and to elevated CO(2) concentrations measured at free-air CO(2) 
      enrichment experiment sites. The results demonstrated that the models with 
      relatively high sensitivity to increasing atmospheric CO(2) concentrations showed a 
      higher increasing GPP trend. The fundamental difference in the CO(2) effect in the 
      models' algorithm either considers the effect of CO(2) through changes in greenness 
      indices (nine models) or introduces the influences on photosynthesis (three models). 
      The overall effects of temperature and radiation, in terms of both magnitude and 
      sign, vary among the models, while the models respond relatively consistently to 
      variations in precipitation. Spatially, larger differences among model sensitivity 
      to climatic factors occur in the tropics; at high latitudes, models have a 
      consistent and obvious positive response to variations in temperature and radiation, 
      and precipitation significantly enhances the GPP in mid-latitudes. Compared with the 
      results calculated by flux-site measurements, the model performance differed 
      substantially among different sites. However, the sensitivities of most models are 
      basically within the confidence interval of the flux-site results. In general, the 
      comparison revealed that models differed substantially in the effect of 
      environmental regulations, particularly CO(2) fertilization and water stress, on 
      GPP, and none of the models performed consistently better across the different 
      ecosystems and under the various external conditions.

AB  - Spatial and temporal changes in land cover have direct impacts on the hydrological 
      cycle and stream quality. Techniques for accurately and efficiently mapping these 
      changes are evolving quickly, and it is important to evaluate how useful these 
      techniques are to address the environmental impact of land cover on riparian buffer 
      areas. The objectives of this study were to: (1) determine the classes and 
      distribution of land cover in the riparian areas of streams; (2) examine the 
      discrepancies within the existing land cover data from National Land Cover Database 
      (NLCD) using high-resolution imagery of the National Agriculture Imagery Program 
      (NAIP) and a LiDAR canopy height model; and (3) develop a technique using LiDAR data 
      to help characterize riparian buffers over large spatial extents. One-meter canopy 
      height models were constructed in a high-throughput computing environment. The 
      machine learning algorithm Support Vector Machine (SVM) was trained to perform 
      supervised land cover classification at a 1-m resolution on the Google Earth Engine 
      (GEE) platform using NAIP imagery and LiDAR-derived canopy height models. This 
      integrated approach to land cover classification provided a substantial improvement 
      in the resolution and accuracy of classifications with F1 Score of each land cover 
      classification ranging from 64.88 to 95.32%. The resulting 1-m land cover map is a 
      highly detailed representation of land cover in the study area. Forests (evergreen 
      and deciduous) and wetlands are by far the dominant land cover classes in riparian 
      zones of the Lower Savannah River Basin, followed by cultivated crops and 
      pasture/hay. Stress from urbanization in the riparian zones appears to be localized. 
      This study demonstrates a method to create accurate high-resolution riparian buffer 
      maps which can be used to improve water management and provide future prospects for 
      improving buffer zones monitoring to assess stream health.

LID - 10.1111/gcb.15373 [doi]
AB  - Effective use of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) to estimate and 
      monitor gross primary production (GPP) in terrestrial ecosystems requires a 
      comprehensive understanding and quantification of the relationship between SIF and 
      GPP. To date, this understanding is incomplete and somewhat controversial in the 
      literature. Here we derived the GPP/SIF ratio from multiple data sources as a 
      diagnostic metric to explore its global-scale patterns of spatial variation and 
      potential climatic dependence. We found that the growing season GPP/SIF ratio varied 
      substantially across global land surfaces, with the highest ratios consistently 
      found in boreal regions. Spatial variation in GPP/SIF was strongly modulated by 
      climate variables. The most striking pattern was a consistent decrease in GPP/SIF 
      from cold-and-wet climates to hot-and-dry climates. We propose that the reduction in 
      GPP/SIF with decreasing moisture availability may be related to stomatal responses 
      to aridity. Furthermore, we show that GPP/SIF can be empirically modeled from 
      climate variables using a machine learning (random forest) framework, which can 
      improve the modeling of ecosystem production and quantify its uncertainty in global 
      terrestrial biosphere models. Our results point to the need for targeted field and 
      experimental studies to better understand the patterns observed and to improve the 
      modeling of the relationship between SIF and GPP over broad scales.

AB  - Our previous studies have profiled lysine acetylation and succinylation 
      modifications in Aeromonas hydrophila protein and have found that CobB may be 
      involved in lysine deacylation; however, its effects on bacterial biological 
      function are still unknown. In this study, a data-independent acquisition 
      (DIA)-based proteomics method was used to compare the protein abundance between 
      cob-deleted mutants and wild-type strains. Of the total 2385 identified proteins, 
      385 were found to have increased abundance, while only 46 showed decreased 
      abundance. Data analysis revealed that many proteins in six metabolic pathways, 
      ribosome, the bacterial secretion system, protein export, RNA degradation, 
      beta-Lactam resistance and oxidative phosphorylation, were affected by the deletion 
      of cobB. Some proteins, such as outer membrane proteins, the two-component 
      regulatory systems and transcriptional factor, were also regulated by cobB. The 
      following phenotype assays confirmed that the ΔcobB mutant produced more biofilm, 
      migrated farther in soft agar, and was more sensitive to oxidative stress than its 
      WT parent. Taken together, the results presented herein provide insights into the 
      behaviors of sirtuin protein CobB in bacteria and demonstrate its important 
      biological functions in A. hydrophila. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The sirtuin protein 
      CobB play crucial roles on lysine deacylation, such as desuccinylation and 
      deacetylation in many bacterial species, while the intrinsic behavior of CobB on 
      bacteria remains elusive. The current DIA-based quantitative proteomics analysis 
      showed that the deletion of A. hydrophila cobB significantly affect the 
      intracellular biological processes. Further phenotype assays validated proteomics 
      results. Overall, our data further confirmed the important roles of CobB on the 
      complex protein-protein interaction network regulation in A. hydrophila.

AB  - The presence of arsenic (As) in agricultural food products is a matter of concern 
      because it can cause adverse health effects at low concentrations. 
      Agricultural-product intake constitutes a principal source for As exposure in 
      humans. In this study, the contribution of the chemical-soil parameters in As 
      accumulation and translocation in the maize crop from a mining area of San Luis 
      Potosi was evaluated. The total arsenic concentration and arsenic speciation were 
      determined by HG-AFS and IC-HG-AFS, respectively. The data analysis was conducted by 
      cluster analysis (CA) and principal component analysis (PCA). The soil pH presented 
      a negative correlation with the accumulated As in each maize plant part, and 
      parameters such as iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) presented a higher correlation with 
      the As translocation in maize. Thus, the metabolic stress in maize may induce 
      organic acid exudation leading a higher As bioavailability. A high As 
      inorganic/organic ratio in edible maize plant tissues suggests a substantial risk of 
      poisoning by this metalloid. Careful attention to the chemical changes in the 
      rhizosphere of the agricultural zones that can affect As transfer through the food 
      chain could reduce the As-intoxication risk of maize consumers.

TI  - An integrated machine learning approach for predicting DosR-regulated genes in 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
PG  - 37
LID - 10.1186/1752-0509-4-37 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: DosR is an important regulator of the response to stress such as limited 
      oxygen availability in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Time course gene expression data 
      enable us to dissect this response on the gene regulatory level. The mRNA expression 
      profile of a regulator, however, is not necessarily a direct reflection of its 
      activity. Knowing the transcription factor activity (TFA) can be exploited to 
      predict novel target genes regulated by the same transcription factor. Various 
      approaches have been proposed to reconstruct TFAs from gene expression data. Most of 
      them capture only a first-order approximation to the complex transcriptional 
      processes by assuming linear gene responses and linear dynamics in TFA, or ignore 
      the temporal information in data from such systems. RESULTS: In this paper, we 
      approach the problem of inferring dynamic hidden TFAs using Gaussian processes (GP). 
      We are able to model dynamic TFAs and to account for both linear and nonlinear gene 
      responses. To test the validity of the proposed approach, we reconstruct the hidden 
      TFA of p53, a tumour suppressor activated by DNA damage, using published time course 
      gene expression data. Our reconstructed TFA is closer to the experimentally 
      determined profile of p53 concentration than that from the original study. We then 
      apply the model to time course gene expression data obtained from chemostat cultures 
      of M. tuberculosis under reduced oxygen availability. After estimation of the TFA of 
      DosR based on a number of known target genes using the GP model, we predict novel 
      DosR-regulated genes: the parameters of the model are interpreted as relevance 
      parameters indicating an existing functional relationship between TFA and gene 
      expression. We further improve the prediction by integrating promoter sequence 
      information in a logistic regression model. Apart from the documented DosR-regulated 
      genes, our prediction yields ten novel genes under direct control of DosR. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Chemostat cultures are an ideal experimental system for controlling 
      noise and variability when monitoring the response of bacterial organisms such as M. 
      tuberculosis to finely controlled changes in culture conditions and available 
      metabolites. Nonlinear hidden TFA dynamics of regulators can be reconstructed 
      remarkably well with Gaussian processes from such data. Moreover, estimated 
      parameters of the GP can be used to assess whether a gene is controlled by the 
      reconstructed TFA or not. It is straightforward to combine these parameters with 
      further information, such as the presence of binding motifs, to increase prediction 
      accuracy.

TI  - Compositional analysis of topsoil metals and its associations with cancer mortality 
      using spatial misaligned data.
PG  - 283-294
LID - 10.1007/s10653-016-9904-3 [doi]
AB  - The presence of toxic metals in soil per se, and in soil impacted by mining, 
      industry, agriculture and urbanisation in particular, is a major concern for both 
      human health and ecotoxicology. The dual aim of this study was: to ascertain whether 
      topsoil composition could influence the spatial distribution of mortality due to 
      different types of cancer and to identify possible errors committed by 
      epidemiological studies which analyse soil composition data as a closed number 
      system. We conducted an ecological cancer mortality study, covering 861,440 cancer 
      deaths (27 cancer sites) in 7917 Spanish mainland towns, from 1999 to 2008. Topsoil 
      levels of Al, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn were determined by ICP-MS at 
      13,317 sampling points. We transformed the topsoil data in two ways, i.e. log 
      transformation and centred logratio transformation. Principal factor analysis was 
      performed to obtain independent latent factors for the transformed variables. To 
      estimate the effect on mortality of topsoil factor loadings, we fitted Besag, York 
      and Mollié models embedded in geostatistical-spatial models. This model included 
      soil sample locations and town centroids (non-aligned data), fitted using the 
      integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) as a tool for Bayesian inference and 
      stochastic partial differential equations (SPDE). All results were adjusted for 
      socio-demographic variables. The results indicated that soil composition could have 
      an influence on the spatial distribution and mortality patterns of cancer. The 
      analysis adjusted for socio-demographic variables showed excess male mortality due 
      to digestive system tumours in areas with soils containing higher Cd, Pb, Zn, Mn and 
      Cu concentrations, bladder cancer in areas with soils containing higher Cd 
      concentrations, and brain cancer in areas with soils containing As. In both sexes, 
      cancer of oesophagus was associated with soils containing a higher lead content, 
      while lung cancer was associated with soils containing a higher copper content. 
      Stress should be laid on the importance of taking into account the compositional 
      nature of the data in this type of analysis.

TI  - INHALEd nebulised unfractionated HEParin for the treatment of hospitalised patients 
      with COVID-19 (INHALE-HEP): Protocol and statistical analysis plan for an 
      investigator-initiated international metatrial of randomised studies.
LID - 10.1111/bcp.14714 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Inhaled nebulised unfractionated heparin (UFH) has a strong scientific and 
      biological rationale that warrants urgent investigation of its therapeutic potential 
      in patients with COVID-19. UFH has antiviral effects and prevents the SARS-CoV-2 
      virus' entry into mammalian cells. In addition, UFH has significant 
      anti-inflammatory and anticoagulant properties, which limit progression of lung 
      injury and vascular pulmonary thrombosis. METHODS: The INHALEd nebulised 
      unfractionated HEParin for the treatment of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 
      (INHALE-HEP) metatrial is a prospective individual patient data analysis of on-going 
      randomised controlled trials and early phase studies. Individual studies are being 
      conducted in multiple countries. Participating studies randomise adult patients 
      admitted to the hospital with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, who do not require 
      immediate mechanical ventilation, to inhaled nebulised UFH or standard care. All 
      studies collect a minimum core dataset. The primary outcome for the metatrial is 
      intubation (or death, for patients who died before intubation) at day 28. The 
      secondary outcomes are oxygenation, clinical worsening and mortality, assessed in 
      time-to-event analyses. Individual studies may have additional outcomes. ANALYSIS: 
      We use a Bayesian approach to monitoring, followed by analysing individual patient 
      data, outcomes and adverse events. All analyses will follow the intention-to-treat 
      principle, considering all participants in the treatment group to which they were 
      assigned, except for cases lost to follow-up or withdrawn. TRIAL REGISTRATION, 
      ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The metatrial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov ID 
      NCT04635241. Each contributing study is individually registered and has received 
      approval of the relevant ethics committee or institutional review board. Results of 
      this study will be shared with the World Health Organisation, published in 
      scientific journals and presented at scientific meetings.

TI  - A randomized controlled trial of suicide prevention training for primary care 
      providers: a study protocol.
PG  - 58
LID - 10.1186/s12909-019-1482-5 [doi]
LID - 58
AB  - BACKGROUND: Suicide is a national public health crisis and a critical patient safety 
      issue. It is the 10th leading cause of death overall and the second leading cause of 
      death among adolescents and young adults (15-34 years old). Research shows 80% of 
      youth who died by suicide saw their primary care provider within the year of their 
      death. It is imperative that primary care providers develop the knowledge and skills 
      to talk with patients about distress and suicidal thoughts, and to assess and 
      respond in the context of the ongoing patient - primary care provider relationship. 
      METHODS: This study examines the effectiveness of simulation on suicide prevention 
      training for providers-in-training by comparing two conditions: 1) a control group 
      that receives online teaching on suicide prevention in primary care via brief online 
      videos and 2) an experimental group that includes the same online teaching videos 
      plus two standardized patient (SP) interactions (face-to-face and telehealth, 
      presentation randomized). All SP interactions are video-recorded. The primary 
      analysis is a comparison of the two groups' suicide prevention skills using an SP 
      "test case" at 6-month follow-up. DISCUSSION: The primary research question examines 
      the impact of practice (through SP simulation) over and above online teaching alone 
      on suicide prevention skills demonstrated at follow-up. We will assess moderators of 
      outcomes, differences among SP simulations (i.e., face-to-face vs. telehealth 
      modalities), and whether the experimental group's suicide prevention skills improve 
      over the three SP experiences. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered on 
      Clinical Trials Registry ( clinicaltrials.gov ) on December 14, 2016. The Trial 
      Registration Number is NCT02996344 .

TI  - Perception of family caregivers about barriers of leisure in care of individuals 
      with chronic psychiatric disorders: a qualitative study.
PG  - 6516-6526
LID - 10.19082/6516 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Family caregivers of individuals with chronic psychiatric disorders play 
      an important role in the management of the patient's conditions, which interferes 
      with other activities of daily living, work, social and leisure activities. 
      OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted in an Iranian context to explore the perception 
      of family caregivers about barriers of leisure in care of individuals with chronic 
      psychiatric disorders. METHODS: The current qualitative study was conducted on the 
      basis of conventional content analysis. Participants were 15 family caregivers of 
      individuals with chronic psychiatric disorders who were selected by Purposeful 
      sampling method between July 2016 and March 2017 in Tehran, Iran. The data was 
      collected via in-depth semi-structured interviews. The interviews were tape 
      recorded, written and transcribed. Then, data were analyzed by inductive content 
      analysis method. RESULTS: Data analysis led to extraction of 3 main categories and 
      10 sub categories. Obstacles to leisure-time of family caregivers have been placed 
      in three main categories which are patient-related factors (Resentment from 
      psychological problems, Resentment from behavioral problems, Need for continuous 
      monitoring and access), caregiver-related factors (Physical harm, Psychosocial harm, 
      Temporal stress, Accumulation of responsibilities, Concerns), and community-related 
      factors (Feeling of sympathy and rejection, Social stigma). CONCLUSION: 
      Understanding the barriers of leisure in this group of family caregivers has 
      contributed to understanding the family caregivers' perception in this area and 
      regarding their leisure, it can provide a broader perspective to mental health 
      therapists, rehabilitation managers and policy makers for understanding the needs, 
      addressing the challenges and barriers of this group of family caregivers.

TI  - An Evidence-Based Health Care Knowledge Integration System: Assessment Protocol.
PG  - e11754
LID - 10.2196/11754 [doi]
LID - e11754
AB  - BACKGROUND: The rapid advancements in health care can make it difficult for general 
      physicians and specialists alike to keep their knowledge up to date. In medicine 
      today, there are deficiencies in the application of knowledge translation (KT) in 
      clinical practice. Some medical procedures are not required, and therefore, no value 
      is added to the patient's care. These unnecessary procedures increase pressures on 
      the health care system's resources, reduce the quality of care, and expose the 
      patients to stress and to other potential risks. KT tools and better access to 
      medical recommendations can lead to improvements in physicians' decision-making 
      processes depending on the patient's specific clinical situation. These tools can 
      provide the physicians with the available options and promote an efficient 
      professional practice. Software for the Evolution of Knowledge in MEDicine (SEKMED) 
      is a technological solution providing access to high-quality evidence, based on 
      just-in-time principles, in the application of medical recommendations for clinical 
      decision-making processes recognized by community members, accreditation bodies, the 
      recommendations from medical specialty societies made available through campaigns 
      such as Choosing Wisely, and different standards or accreditive bodies. OBJECTIVE: 
      The main objective of this protocol is to assess the usefulness of the SEKMED 
      platform used within a real working clinical practice, specifically the Centre 
      intégré de santé et des services sociaux de l'Outaouais in Quebec, Canada. To 
      achieve our main objective, 20 emergency physicians from the Hull and Gatineau 
      Hospitals participate in the project as well as 20 patient care unit physicians from 
      the Hull Hospital. In addition, 10 external students or residents studying family 
      medicine from McGill University will also participate in our study. METHODS: The 
      project is divided into 4 phases: (1) orientation; (2) data synthesis; (3) develop 
      and validate the recommendations; and (4) implement, monitor, and update the 
      recommendations. These phases will enable us to meet our 6 specific research 
      objectives that aim to measure the integration of recommendations in clinical 
      practices, the before and after improvements in practices, the value attributed by 
      physicians to recommendations, the user's platform experience, the educational 
      benefits according to medical students, and the organizational benefits according to 
      stakeholders. The knowledge gained during each phase will be applied on an iterative 
      and continuous basis to all other phases over a period of 2 years. RESULTS: This 
      project was funded in April 2018 by the Fonds de soutien à l'innovation en santé et 
      en services sociaux for 24 months. Ethics approval has been attained, the study 
      began in June 2018, the data collection will be complete at the end of December 
      2019, and the data analysis will start in winter 2020. Both major city hospitals in 
      the Outaouais region, Quebec, Canada, have agreed to participate in the project. 
      CONCLUSIONS: If results show preliminary efficacy and usability of the system, a 
      large-scale implementation will be conducted. INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT

AB  - BACKGROUND: In 2011, Medicare implemented a prospective payment system (PPS) 
      covering an expanded bundle of services that excluded blood transfusions. This led 
      to concern about inappropriate substitution of transfusions for other anemia 
      management methods. STUDY DESIGN: Medicare claims were used to calculate transfusion 
      rates among dialysis patients pre- and post-PPS. Linear probability regressions 
      adjusted transfusion trends for patient characteristics. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 
      Dialysis patients for whom Medicare was the primary payer between 2008 and 2012. 
      PREDICTOR: Pre-PPS (2008-2010) versus post-PPS (2011-2012). OUTCOMES & MEASUREMENTS: 
      Monthly and annual probability of receiving one or more blood transfusions. RESULTS: 
      Monthly rates of one or more transfusions varied from 3.8%-4.8% and tended to be 
      lowest in 2010. Annual rates of transfusion events per patient were -10% higher in 
      relative terms post-PPS, but the absolute magnitude of the increase was modest 
      (-0.05 events/patient). A larger proportion received 4 or more transfusions (3.3% in 
      2011 and 2012 vs 2.7%-2.8% in prior years). Controlling for patient characteristics, 
      the monthly probability of receiving a transfusion was significantly higher post-PPS 
      (β = 0.0034; P < 0.001), representing an -7% relative increase. Transfusions were 
      more likely for females and patients with more comorbid conditions and less likely 
      for blacks both pre- and post-PPS. LIMITATIONS: Possible underidentification of 
      transfusions in the Medicare claims, particularly in the inpatient setting. Also, we 
      do not observe which patients might be appropriate candidates for kidney 
      transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Transfusion rates increased post-PPS, but these 
      increases were modest in both absolute and relative terms. The largest increase 
      occurred for patients already receiving several transfusions. Although these 
      findings may reduce concerns regarding the impact of Medicare's PPS on inappropriate 
      transfusions that impair access to kidney transplantation or stress blood bank 
      resources, transfusions should continue to be monitored.

TI  - Global proteome and phosphoproteome dynamics indicate novel mechanisms of vitamin C 
      induced dormancy in Mycobacterium smegmatis.

AB  - Vitamin C has been found to affect mycobacteria in multiple ways, including 
      increasing susceptibility to antimicrobial drugs, inducing dormancy, and having a 
      bactericidal effect. However, the regulatory events mediating vitamin C related 
      adaptations remain largely elusive. Ser/Thr/Tyr protein phosphorylation plays an 
      important regulatory role in mycobacteria, contributing to environmental adaptation, 
      including dormancy and drug resistance. This study utilised the model organism, 
      Mycobacterium smegmatis, and TiO(2) phosphopeptide enrichment combined with mass 
      spectrometry-based proteomics methods to elucidate the mycobacterial signalling and 
      regulatory response to sub-lethal concentrations of vitamin C. After initial 
      validation of peptide spectra, 224 non-redundant phosphosites in 154 proteins were 
      retained with high confidence. Data analysis revealed that 30 peptides were 
      differentially phosphorylated with Vitamin C treatment, including novel phosphosites 
      found on both PknG and GarA. Of these significant proteins, we validated 11 by 
      parallel reaction monitoring of high-confidence phosphopeptides. Interestingly, 
      17/30 phosphopeptides were annotated as part of transmembrane proteins, suggesting 
      that it is likely vitamin C triggers typical signal transduction events in which the 
      protein periplasmic domain perceives environmental signals and the cytoplasmic 
      domain is then phosphorylated. Finally, the diverse nature of phosphorylated 
      proteins involved in signalling, transport, and carbohydrate biosynthesis indicates 
      the extent of such regulatory phosphorylation events. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Our 
      findings provide new mechanistic insight into a coordinated network of signalling 
      and regulatory responses to sub-lethal vitamin C in Mycobacterium smegmatis and 
      provide evidence that vitamin C is able to act as a novel extracellular signalling 
      molecule. Vitamin C treatment caused changes in both the proteome and 
      phosphoproteome associated with response to oxidative stress, a shift in metabolic 
      regulation and progression toward dormancy, as well as phospho-dependent activation 
      of specific secretory pathways and activation of specific two component and 
      Ser/Thr/Tyr protein kinase activities. This study confirms the potential of vitamin 
      C as convenient means to study aspects of mycobacterial dormancy, including those 
      regulated at post-translational level.

TI  - Association of PNC, BC, and PM2.5 measured at a central monitoring site with blood 
      pressure in a predominantly near highway population.
PG  - 2765-80
LID - 10.3390/ijerph120302765 [doi]
AB  - Elevated blood pressure is an indicator of cardiovascular stress and increased risk 
      of cardiovascular-related morbidity and mortality. There is emerging evidence 
      suggesting air pollutants, including particulate matter (PM), could promote 
      hypertension, thereby increasing cardiovascular disease risk. Repeated measurement 
      analyses were conducted to examine the associations of three types of PM with 
      systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and pulse pressure 
      (PP) in 220 participants, (mean age=58.5 years) from the Community Assessment of 
      Freeway Exposure and Health study (CAFEH), most of whom live near a major highway. 
      Ambient levels of air pollutants including particle number concentration (PNC; a 
      measure of ultrafine particle (UFP) concentration), fine PM (PM2.5, Particle 
      diameter<2.5 µm), and black carbon (BC) were measured at a central site<7 km from 
      the study areas. Central sites are good at capturing short-term temporal trends in 
      pollution associated with meteorological changes over regional areas. Linear 
      mixed-effect models that accounted for repeated measures within one person were used 
      to examine the associations between blood pressure variables and daily average of 
      ambient PNC, PM2.5, or BC, controlling for demographic characteristics and major 
      confounders including temperature. Our PNC model predicted that a higher PNC of 
      10,000 particles/cm3 was associated with higher DBP of 2.40 mmHg (p=0.03), 
      independent of other factors in the model. There were no significant associations 
      for PM2.5 or BC. Post hoc subgroup analyses by obesity status showed that positive 
      associations of DBP with PNC were more pronounced among obese individuals than 
      non-obese individuals. These results suggested that PNC levels are associated with 
      increased blood pressure, which may contribute to cardiovascular disease risk. More 
      research is needed to assess the relationship between PNC and blood pressure and to 
      address possible residual confounding.

TI  - Challenges associated with insulin therapy progression among patients with type 2 
      diabetes: Latin American MOSAIc study baseline data.

LID - 41
AB  - BACKGROUND: Poor glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes is commonly 
      recorded worldwide; Latin America (LA) is not an exception. Barriers to intensifying 
      insulin therapy and which barriers are most likely to negatively impact outcomes are 
      not completely known. The objective was to identify barriers to insulin progression 
      in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in LA countries (Mexico, Brazil, 
      and Argentina). METHODS: MOSAIc is a multinational, non-interventional, prospective, 
      observational study aiming to identify the patient-, physician-, and 
      healthcare-based factors affecting insulin intensification. Eligible patients were 
      ≥18 years, had T2DM, and were treated with insulin for ≥3 months with/without oral 
      antidiabetic drugs (OADs). Demographic, clinical, and psychosocial data were 
      collected at baseline and regular intervals during the 24-month follow-up period. 
      This paper however, focuses on baseline data analysis. The association between 
      glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and selected covariates was assessed. RESULTS: A trend 
      toward a higher level of HbA1c was observed in the LA versus non-LA population 
      (8.40 ± 2.79 versus 8.18 ± 2.28; p ≤ 0.069). Significant differences were observed 
      in clinical parameters, treatment patterns, and patient-reported outcomes in LA 
      compared with the rest of the cohorts and between Mexico, Brazil, and Argentina. 
      Higher number of insulin injections and lower number of OADs were used, whereas a 
      lower level of knowledge and a higher level of diabetes-related distress were 
      reported in LA. Covariates associated with HbA1c levels included age (-0.0129; 
      p < 0.0001), number of OADs (0.0835; p = 0.0264), higher education level (-0.2261; 
      p = 0.0101), healthy diet (-0.0555; p = 0.0083), self-monitoring blood glucose 
      (-0.0512; p = 0.0033), hurried communication style in the process of care (0.1295; 
      p = 0.0208), number of insulin injections (0.1616; p = 0.0088), adherence (-0.1939; 
      p ≤ 0.0104), and not filling insulin prescription due to associated cost (0.2651; 
      p = 0.0198). CONCLUSION: MOSAIc baseline data showed that insulin intensification in 
      LA is not optimal and identified several conditions that significantly affect 
      attaining appropriate HbA1c values. Tailored public health strategies, including 
      education, should be developed to overcome such barriers. Trial Registration

TI  - Daily CO(2) Emission Reduction Indicates the Control of Activities to Contain 
      COVID-19 in China.

AB  - Lockdown measures are essential to containing the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 
      (COVID-19), but they will slow down economic growth by reducing industrial and 
      commercial activities. However, the benefits of activity control from containing the 
      pandemic have not been examined and assessed. Here we use daily carbon dioxide 
      (CO(2)) emission reduction in China estimated from statistical data for energy 
      consumption and satellite data for nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) measured by the Ozone 
      Monitoring Instrument (OMI) as an indicator for reduced activities consecutive to a 
      lockdown. We perform a correlation analysis to show that a 1% day(-1) decrease in 
      the rate of COVID-19 cases is associated with a reduction in daily CO(2) emissions 
      of 0.22% ± 0.02% using statistical data for energy consumption relative to emissions 
      without COVID-19, or 0.20% ± 0.02% using satellite data for atmospheric column 
      NO(2). We estimate that swift action in China is effective in limiting the number of 
      COVID-19 cases <100,000 with a reduction in CO(2) emissions of up to 23% by the end 
      of February 2020, whereas a 1-week delay would have required greater containment and 
      a doubling of the emission reduction to meet the same goal. By analyzing the costs 
      of health care and fatalities, we find that the benefits on public health due to 
      reduced activities in China are 10-fold larger than the loss of gross domestic 
      product. Our findings suggest an unprecedentedly high cost of maintaining activities 
      and CO(2) emissions during the COVID-19 pandemic and stress substantial benefits of 
      containment in public health by taking early actions to reduce activities during the 
      outbreak of COVID-19.

AB  - The ribosomal DNA (rDNA) can act as a sensor and responder of cancer-associated 
      stress. Here we investigated rDNA copy number in gastric cancers and its association 
      with existing biomarkers and metals exposure. This study was performed on paired 
      tumor and adjacent normal tissues obtained from 65 gastric cancer patients who 
      underwent gastrectomy. Immunohistochemistry was used to assess HER-2, E-cadherin, 
      EGFR, CK (pan), CK20, CK7, TopoⅡ, CAM5.2, P53, and Ki-67 expression. Inductively 
      coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was used to detect the concentrations of 
      17 metals in gastric tissues. rDNA copy number was detected by qPCR in genomic DNA 
      isolated from tissue samples. Associations between the expression of existing 
      markers, metal concentrations, and rDNA copy number were evaluated. Within patients 
      with gastric cancer, the copy number of the 45S rDNA components (18S, 5.8S, 28S) and 
      the 5S rDNA in tumor tissues were significantly higher than those in adjacent normal 
      tissues, whereas mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number was significantly lower in 
      tumor tissues than that in adjacent normal tissues. Further analysis revealed that 
      the increase in 18S, 5.8S, and 28S rDNA copy number in tumor tissues was diminished 
      in the context of EGFR and P53 loss. Moreover, analysis of metals revealed 
      particularly high concentrations of As, Cd, Cr, Cu and Fe in the gastric tissues of 
      these patients. Intriguingly, rDNA copy number variation across individuals was 
      correlated with the concentrations of some metals. The rDNA was amplified in tumor 
      tissues of gastric cancer patients, and its amplification may be associated with 
      metals exposure. The expression of EGFR and P53 may influence rDNA copy number, with 
      diminished amplification of the rDNA in cancers that were negative for these 
      biomarkers. Our observation further our understanding of rDNA copy number in gastric 
      cancer and its potential as a simple and useful marker in gastric cancer monitoring.

TI  - Comparison of whole blood and peripheral blood mononuclear cell gene expression for 
      evaluation of the perioperative inflammatory response in patients with advanced 
      heart failure.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) prevalence is increasing in the United States. 
      Mechanical Circulatory Support (MCS) therapy is an option for Advanced HF (AdHF) 
      patients. Perioperatively, multiorgan dysfunction (MOD) is linked to the effects of 
      device implantation, augmented by preexisting HF. Early recognition of MOD allows 
      for better diagnosis, treatment, and risk prediction. Gene expression profiling 
      (GEP) was used to evaluate clinical phenotypes of peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
      (PBMC) transcriptomes obtained from patients' blood samples. Whole blood (WB) 
      samples are clinically more feasible, but their performance in comparison to PBMC 
      samples has not been determined. METHODS: We collected blood samples from 31 HF 
      patients (57±15 years old) undergoing cardiothoracic surgery and 7 healthy 
      age-matched controls, between 2010 and 2011, at a single institution. WB and PBMC 
      samples were collected at a single timepoint postoperatively (median day 8 
      postoperatively) (25-75% IQR 7-14 days) and subjected to Illumina single color Human 
      BeadChip HT12 v4 whole genome expression array analysis. The Sequential Organ 
      Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was used to characterize the severity of MOD into 
      low (≤ 4 points), intermediate (5-11), and high (≥ 12) risk categories correlating 
      with GEP. RESULTS: Results indicate that the direction of change in GEP of 
      individuals with MOD as compared to controls is similar when determined from PBMC 
      versus WB. The main enriched terms by Gene Ontology (GO) analysis included those 
      involved in the inflammatory response, apoptosis, and other stress response related 
      pathways. The data revealed 35 significant GO categories and 26 pathways overlapping 
      between PBMC and WB. Additionally, class prediction using machine learning tools 
      demonstrated that the subset of significant genes shared by PBMC and WB are 
      sufficient to train as a predictor separating the SOFA groups. CONCLUSION: GEP 
      analysis of WB has the potential to become a clinical tool for immune-monitoring in 
      patients with MOD.

TI  - Interactive XCMS Online: simplifying advanced metabolomic data processing and 
      subsequent statistical analyses.
PG  - 6931-9
LID - 10.1021/ac500734c [doi]
AB  - XCMS Online (xcmsonline.scripps.edu) is a cloud-based informatic platform designed 
      to process and visualize mass-spectrometry-based, untargeted metabolomic data. 
      Initially, the platform was developed for two-group comparisons to match the 
      independent, "control" versus "disease" experimental design. Here, we introduce an 
      enhanced XCMS Online interface that enables users to perform dependent (paired) 
      two-group comparisons, meta-analysis, and multigroup comparisons, with comprehensive 
      statistical output and interactive visualization tools. Newly incorporated 
      statistical tests cover a wide array of univariate analyses. Multigroup comparison 
      allows for the identification of differentially expressed metabolite features across 
      multiple classes of data while higher order meta-analysis facilitates the 
      identification of shared metabolic patterns across multiple two-group comparisons. 
      Given the complexity of these data sets, we have developed an interactive platform 
      where users can monitor the statistical output of univariate (cloud plots) and 
      multivariate (PCA plots) data analysis in real time by adjusting the threshold and 
      range of various parameters. On the interactive cloud plot, metabolite features can 
      be filtered out by their significance level (p-value), fold change, mass-to-charge 
      ratio, retention time, and intensity. The variation pattern of each feature can be 
      visualized on both extracted-ion chromatograms and box plots. The interactive 
      principal component analysis includes scores, loadings, and scree plots that can be 
      adjusted depending on scaling criteria. The utility of XCMS functionalities is 
      demonstrated through the metabolomic analysis of bacterial stress response and the 
      comparison of lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been affecting people's 
      psychosocial health and well-being through various complex pathways. The present 
      study aims to investigate the perceived psychosocial health and its sociodemographic 
      correlates among Chinese community-dwelling residents. METHODS: This cross-sectional 
      survey was carried out online and using a structured questionnaire during April 
      2020. In total, 4788 men and women with the age range of 11-98 years from eight 
      provinces in eastern, central and western China were included in the analysis. We 
      adopted a tactical approach to capture three key domains of perceived psychosocial 
      health that are more likely to occur during a pandemic including hopelessness, 
      loneliness, and depression. Multiple regression method, binary logistic regression 
      model and variance inflation factor (VIF) were used to conduct data analysis. 
      RESULTS: Respectively 34.8%, 32.5% and 44.8% of the participants expressed feeling 
      more hopeless, lonely, and depressed during the pandemic. The percentage of all 
      three indicators was comparatively higher among women than among men: hopelessness 
      (50.7% vs 49.3%), loneliness (52.4% vs 47.6%), and depression (56.2% vs 43.8%). 
      Being married was associated with lower odds of loneliness among men (odds ratio 
      [OR] = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.45-0.90). Loneliness was negatively associated with smoking 
      (OR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.45-0.99) and positively associated with drinking (OR = 1.45, 
      95% CI: 1.04-2.02). Compared with those in the lowest income bracket (< CNY 10 000), 
      men (OR = 0.34, 95% CI: 0.21-0.55) and women (OR = 0.36, 95% CI: 0.23-0.56) in the 
      highest level of annually housed income (> CNY 40 000) had the lowest odds of 
      reporting perceived hopelessness (OR = 0.35, 95% CI: 0.25-0.48). Smoking also showed 
      negative association with depression only among men (OR = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.43-0.91). 
      CONCLUSIONS: More than one-third of the participants reported worsening in the 
      experience of hopelessness and loneliness, with more than two-fifth of worsening 
      depression during the pandemic compared with before the outbreak. Several 
      socioeconomic and lifestyle factors were found to be associated with the outcome 
      variables, most notably participants' marital status, household income, smoking, 
      alcohol drinking, existing chronic conditions. These findings may be of significance 
      to treat patients and help them recover from the pandemic.

TI  - DNA Damage in Euonymus japonicus Leaf Cells Caused by Roadside Pollution in Beijing.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph13070742 [doi]
LID - 742
AB  - The inhalable particles from vehicle exhaust can cause DNA damage to exposed 
      organisms. Research on DNA damage is primarily focused on the influence of specific 
      pollutants on certain species or the effect of environmental pollution on human 
      beings. To date, little research has quantitatively studied the relationship between 
      roadside pollution and DNA damage. Based on an investigation of the roadside 
      pollution in Beijing, Euonymus japonicus leaves of differing ages grown in 
      heavily-polluted sections were chosen as biomonitors to detect DNA damage using the 
      comet assay technique. The percentage of DNA in the tail and tail moment was chosen 
      as the analysis index based on SPSS data analysis. The roadside samples showed 
      significantly higher levels of DNA damage than non-roadside samples, which increased 
      in older leaves, and the DNA damage to Euonymus japonicus leaf cells was positively 
      correlated with haze-aggravated roadside pollution. The correlation between damage 
      and the Air Quality Index (AQI) are 0.921 (one-year-old leaves), 0.894 (two-year-old 
      leaves), and 0.878 (three-year-old leaves). Over time, the connection between DNA 
      damage and AQI weakened, with the sensitivity coefficient for δyear 1 being larger 
      than δyear 2 and δyear 3. These findings support the suitability and sensitivity of 
      the comet assay for surveying plants for an estimation of DNA damage induced by 
      environmental genotoxic agents. This study might be applied as a preliminary 
      quantitative method for Chinese urban air pollution damage assessment caused by 
      environmental stress.

TI  - The Canadian Biomarker Integration Network in Depression (CAN-BIND): magnetic 
      resonance imaging protocols.
PG  - 223-236
AB  - Studies of clinical populations that combine MRI data generated at multiple sites 
      are increasingly common. The Canadian Biomarker Integration Network in Depression 
      (CAN-BIND; www.canbind.ca) is a national depression research program that includes 
      multimodal neuroimaging collected at several sites across Canada. The purpose of the 
      current paper is to provide detailed information on the imaging protocols used in a 
      number of CAN-BIND studies. The CAN-BIND program implemented a series of 
      platform-specific MRI protocols, including a suite of prescribed structural and 
      functional MRI sequences supported by real-time monitoring for adherence and quality 
      control. The imaging data are retained in an established informatics and databasing 
      platform. Approximately 1300 participants are being recruited, including almost 1000 
      with depression. These include participants treated with antidepressant medications, 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation, cognitive behavioural therapy and cognitive 
      remediation therapy. Our ability to analyze the large number of imaging variables 
      available may be limited by the sample size of the substudies. The CAN-BIND program 
      includes a multimodal imaging database supported by extensive clinical, demographic, 
      neuropsychological and biological data from people with major depression. It is a 
      resource for Canadian investigators who are interested in understanding whether 
      aspects of neuroimaging — alone or in combination with other variables — can predict 
      the outcomes of various treatment modalities.

TI  - Evaluation of Over-The-Row Harvester Damage in a Super-High-Density Olive Orchard 
      Using On-Board Sensing Techniques.
LID - 10.3390/s18041242 [doi]
LID - 1242
AB  - New super-high-density (SHD) olive orchards designed for mechanical harvesting using 
      over-the-row harvesters are becoming increasingly common around the world. Some 
      studies regarding olive SHD harvesting have focused on the effective removal of the 
      olive fruits; however, the energy applied to the canopy by the harvesting machine 
      that can result in fruit damage, structural damage or extra stress on the trees has 
      been little studied. Using conventional analyses, this study investigates the 
      effects of different nominal speeds and beating frequencies on the removal 
      efficiency and the potential for fruit damage, and it uses remote sensing to 
      determine changes in the plant structures of two varieties of olive trees 
      (&lsquo;Manzanilla Cacere&ntilde;a&rsquo; and &lsquo;Manzanilla de Sevilla&rsquo;) 
      planted in SHD orchards harvested by an over-the-row harvester. &lsquo;Manzanilla de 
      Sevilla&rsquo; fruit was the least tolerant to damage, and for this variety, 
      harvesting at the highest nominal speed led to the greatest percentage of fruits 
      with cuts. Different vibration patterns were applied to the olive trees and were 
      evaluated using triaxial accelerometers. The use of two light detection and ranging 
      (LiDAR) sensing devices allowed us to evaluate structural changes in the studied 
      olive trees. Before- and after-harvest measurements revealed significant differences 
      in the LiDAR data analysis, particularly at the highest nominal speed. The results 
      of this work show that the operating conditions of the harvester are key to 
      minimising fruit damage and that a rapid estimate of the damage produced by an 
      over-the-row harvester with contactless sensing could provide useful information for 
      automatically adjusting the machine parameters in individual olive groves in the 
      future.

LID - 26
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Urinary nicotine and cotinine levels are often measured as biomarkers 
      for tobacco smoke exposure. However, these biomarkers are not appropriate to 
      evaluate the effects of quitting smoking for several days, because of their short 
      half-lives. In this study, we focused on the changes in the urinary 
      4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL) levels of 55 patients in a 
      smoking cessation program, because of the long half-life. At the same time, urinary 
      7-methylguanine (m(7)Gua) and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), as DNA damage 
      markers of cigarette smoking, were also measured. RESULTS: In the subjects who 
      completed the quit-smoking program (18 subjects out of 55), the urinary nicotine and 
      cotinine levels decreased to 1.7 and 0.2% at 8 weeks after the first visit to the 
      clinic. By contrast, the NNAL levels decreased to 12.3% at 8 weeks after quitting 
      smoking. During the same period, the urinary m(7)Gua levels significantly decreased, 
      from 27.32 μg/mg creatinine to 14.17 μg/mg creatinine by the elimination of subjects 
      who showed increased levels of NNAL during the smoking cessation program. The 8-OHdG 
      levels were also reduced within the same period, but were not significantly 
      different. From the all data analysis, the urinary levels of cotinine and NNAL 
      positively correlated with the level of m(7)Gua. CONCLUSIONS: NNAL may be an 
      appropriate exposure marker for evaluating the smoking status of patients in a 
      smoking cessation program. The urinary cotinine and NNAL levels positively 
      correlated with the m(7)Gua levels.

TI  - A randomised controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of tai chi alongside usual

AB  - BACKGROUND: Falls are a public health issue for the older adult population and more 
      so for people with dementia (PWD). Compared with their cognitively intact peers, PWD 
      are at higher risk of falls and injurious falls. This randomised controlled trial 
      aims to test the clinical and cost effectiveness of Tai Chi to improve postural 
      balance among community-dwelling PWD and to assess the feasibility of conducting a 
      larger definitive trial to reduce the incidence of falls among PWD. METHODS: A 
      3-centre parallel group randomised controlled trial with embedded process 
      evaluation. One hundred and fifty community-dwelling dyads of a person with dementia 
      and their informal carer will be recruited and assessed at baseline and at six-month 
      follow-up. Dyads will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either usual care or usual 
      care plus a Tai Chi intervention for 20 weeks. The Tai Chi intervention will consist 
      of weekly classes (45 min' Tai Chi plus up to 45 min for informal discussion, with 
      up to 10 dyads per class) and home-based exercises (20 min per day to be facilitated 
      by the carer). Home practice of Tai Chi will be supported by the use of behaviour 
      change techniques with the Tai Chi instructor at a home visit in week 3-4 of the 
      intervention (action planning, coping planning, self-monitoring, and alarm clock 
      reminder) and at the end of each class (feedback on home practice). The primary 
      outcome is dynamic balance measured using the Timed Up and Go test, coinciding with 
      the end of the 20-week intervention phase for participants in the Tai Chi arm. 
      Secondary outcomes for PWD include functional balance, static balance, fear of 
      falling, global cognitive functioning, visual-spatial cognitive functioning, quality 
      of life, and falls. Secondary outcomes for carers include dynamic balance, static 
      balance, quality of life, costs, and carer burden. DISCUSSION: This trial is the 
      first in the UK to test the effectiveness of Tai Chi to improve balance among PWD. 
      The trial will inform a future study that will be the first in the world to use Tai 
      Chi in a trial to prevent falls among PWD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02864056 .

      implicated in Huntington disease (HD). Increased levels of 8OHdG have been reported 
      in the caudate, parietal cortex, and peripherally in the serum and leukocytes, in 
      patients diagnosed with HD. However, little is known about levels in prodromal 
      patients and changes that might occur as the disease progresses. To address these 
      issues, 8OHdG was tracked over time for a subset of participants enrolled in the 
      PREDICT-HD study. Participants were stratified into four groups based on proximity 
      to HD diagnosis at study entry: Controls (gene-negative individuals), Low (low 
      probability of near-future diagnosis), Medium, and High. Blood samples were analyzed 
      using Liquid Chromatography Electrochemical Array, and for comparison purposes, a 
      separate cross-sectional sample was analyzed using liquid chromatography coupled 
      with multiple-reaction-monitoring mass spectrometry. Longitudinal data analysis 
      showed that initial status (at study entry) and annual rate of change varied as a 
      function of proximity group, adjusting for sex, education, age at study entry, and 
      site effects. Overall levels were lowest for the Control group and highest for the 
      High group, and the rate of increase varied in a similar manner. The finding that 
      8OHdG concentrations increased as a function of proximity to projected disease 
      diagnosis and duration indicates support for the continued assessment of 8OHdG as a 
      robust clinical HD biomarker.

      within the communities of the Makamba and Kayanza provinces in the Republic of 
      Burundi: an exploratory study".

AB  - BACKGROUND: Increased availability of maternal health services alone does not lead 
      to better outcomes for maternal health.The services need to be utilized first.One 
      way to increase service utilization is to plan responsive health care services by 
      taking into account the community's views or expressed needs. Burundi has a high 
      maternal mortality ratio, and despite improvements in health infrastructure, skilled 
      staff and the abolition of user fees for pregnant women,utilization of maternal 
      health services remains low. Possible reasons for this include a lack of responsive 
      healthcare services. An exploratory study was conducted in 2013 in two provinces of 
      Burundi (Makamba and Kayanza), with the aim to collect the experiences of women and 
      men with the maternal health services,their views regarding those services, channels 
      used to express these experiences, and the providers' reaction. METHODS: 
      Semi-structured interviews were used to collect data from men and women and key 
      informants, including community health workers, health committee members, health 
      providers, local authorities, religious leaders and managers of non-governmental 
      organizations. Data analysis was facilitated by MAXQDA 11 software. RESULTS: 
      Negative experiences with maternal health services were reported and included poor 
      staff behavior towards women and a lack of medicine. Health committees and 
      suggestion boxes were introduced by the government to channel the community's views. 
      However, they are not used by the community members, who prefer to use community 
      health workers as intermediaries. Fear of expressing oneself linked to the post-war 
      context of Burundi, social and gender norms, and religious norms limit 
      the expression of community members' views, especially those of women. The limited 
      appreciation of community health workers by the providers further hampers 
      communication and acceptance of the community's views by health providers. 
      CONCLUSION: In Burundi, the community voice to express views on maternal health 
      services is encountering obstacles and needs to be strengthened,especially the 
      women's voice. Community mobilization in the form of a mass immunization campaign 
      day organized by women fora, and community empowerment using participatory 
      approaches could contribute towards community voice strengthening.

      Ethical approval was obtained from the Burundian national ethical committee. 
      Interviews were conducted in an isolated and quiet place to ensure confidentiality. 
      Anonymity was ensured by using codes instead of names of the people involved. Women 
      were interviewed by female researchers. The women were informed about associations 
      providing moral and psychological support if they had difficult or painful memories 
      related to experiences with maternal health services. Informed verbal consent and 
      agreement to record the interview were obtained from the participants before 
      interviewing. The ethical committee had made obtaining the consent to participate 
      orally or in a written form a mandatory ethical requirement for the study. Given the 
      high level of illiteracy within Burundian rural areas, researchers chose to use the 
      verbal consent. The participants were also informed about their right to stop the 
      interview at any time. CONSENT FOR PUBLICATION: Consent for the publication of raw 
      data was deemed unnecessary as the dataset ensures sufficient anonymity with no 
      possibility to identify study participants. This can be verified by any user of the 
      dataset. COMPETING INTERESTS: The authors declare that they have no competing 
      interests. PUBLISHER’S NOTE: Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to 
      jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Offspring of women with type 1 diabetes are at increased risk of fetal 
      growth patterns which are associated with perinatal morbidity. Our aim was to 
      compare rates of large- and small-for-gestational age (LGA; SGA) defined according 
      to different criteria, using data from the Continuous Glucose Monitoring in Type 1 
      Diabetes Pregnancy Trial (CONCEPTT). METHODS: This was a pre-specified analysis of 
      CONCEPTT involving 225 pregnant women and liveborn infants from 31 international 
      centres ( ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01788527; registered 11/2/2013). Infants were 
      weighed immediately at birth and GROW, INTERGROWTH and WHO centiles were calculated. 
      Relative risk ratios, sensitivity and specificity were used to assess the different 
      growth standards with respect to perinatal outcomes, including neonatal 
      hypoglycaemia, hyperbilirubinaemia, respiratory distress, neonatal intensive care 
      unit (NICU) admission and a composite neonatal outcome. RESULTS: Accelerated fetal 
      growth was common, with mean birthweight percentiles of 82.1, 85.7 and 63.9 and LGA 
      rates of 62, 67 and 30% using GROW, INTERGROWTH and WHO standards respectively. 
      Corresponding rates of SGA were 2.2, 1.3 and 8.9% respectively. LGA defined 
      according to GROW centiles showed stronger associations with preterm delivery, 
      neonatal hypoglycaemia, hyperbilirubinaemia and NICU admission. Infants born 
      > 97.7th centile were at highest risk of complications. SGA defined according to 
      INTERGROWTH centiles showed slightly stronger associations with perinatal outcomes. 
      CONCLUSIONS: GROW and INTERGROWTH standards performed similarly and identified 
      similar numbers of neonates with LGA and SGA. GROW-defined LGA and 
      INTERGROWTH-defined SGA had slightly stronger associations with neonatal 
      complications. WHO standards underestimated size in preterm infants and are less 
      applicable for use in type 1 diabetes. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial is registered 
      with ClinicalTrials.gov . number NCT01788527 . Trial registered 11/2/2013.

BTI - Screening for High Blood Pressure in Adults: A Systematic Evidence Review for the 
      U.S. Preventive Services Task Force
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We conducted this systematic review to support the U.S. Preventive 
      Services Task Force (USPSTF) in updating its recommendation on screening for high 
      blood pressure (BP) in nonpregnant adults. DATA SOURCES: We searched relevant 
      databases and literature sources from 2003 to June 17, 2013 to identify existing 
      systematic reviews. For Key Questions (KQs) 1 and 5, we searched MEDLINE, PubMed, 
      Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Clinical Trials, and the Cumulative Index 
      to Nursing and Allied Health Literature from 2003 to February 24, 2014 to locate 
      relevant studies. For KQs 2 and 3, we searched MEDLINE, PubMed, and the Cochrane 
      Central Register for Controlled Clinical Trials from January 1, 1992 to February 24, 
      2014 for relevant studies. For KQ 4, we searched MEDLINE and PubMed from January 1, 
      1966 to February 24, 2014 to identify longitudinal cohort studies of rescreening. 
      STUDY SELECTION: We conducted a dual independent review of 19,309 abstracts and 
      1,171 full-text articles against a priori inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two 
      investigators also independently critically appraised each included article using 
      criteria defined by the USPSTF and supplemented with criteria from the Quality 
      Assessment of Studies of Diagnostic Accuracy II, the Quality in Prognosis Studies 
      tool, and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for diagnostic accuracy (KQs 2 and 3), 
      prognostic (KQ 3), and observational (KQs 4 and 5) studies, respectively. We 
      resolved discrepancies through discussion and consultation with a third reviewer, 
      when necessary. We included only fair- or good-quality studies. DATA ANALYSIS: For 
      KQs 1 and 5, we qualitatively summarized results because of the small number of 
      included studies. For KQ 2, we calculated the diagnostic accuracy of office-based BP 
      measurement (OBPM) devices and protocols using the result from the most commonly 
      recommended device (i.e., manual mercury sphygmomanometer) or protocol component 
      (e.g., no caffeine) as the reference standard. We qualitatively summarized the 
      results. For the prognosis component of KQ 3, we grouped outcomes into the 
      categories of cardiovascular (CV), stroke, and cardiac events. We combined fatal and 
      nonfatal events within these outcome categories. Risk was consistently expressed as 
      a hazard ratio per increment in BP measurement across all included studies. Risk 
      results for CV outcomes by BP measurement method at baseline were visualized in 
      forest plots of hazard ratios. For diagnostic accuracy calculations, we used the BP 
      measurement method that best predicted CV outcomes (i.e., ambulatory BP monitoring 
      [ABPM]) as the reference standard. We qualitatively evaluated how patient or study 
      characteristics influenced diagnostic accuracy. For KQ 4, we pooled incidence rates 
      for the overall populations in included studies to generate a weighted mean 
      incidence at various rescreening intervals, which were categorized into 1, 2, 3, 4, 
      and 5 years. We qualitatively examined direct evidence from subgroup results 
      reported within studies to address the influence of patient characteristics. 
      RESULTS: One randomized, controlled trial (39 clusters; n=140,642) of a Canadian BP 
      screening program that targeted adults age 65 years or older reported 3.02 fewer 
      annual hospital admissions for cardiovascular disease per 1,000 persons in the 
      intervention group compared with the no screening group. When the trial data were 
      analyzed by number of unique persons with hospital admissions, there was a 
      significant relative reduction only in the individual outcome of acute myocardial 
      infarction (rate ratio, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.79 to 0.99]; p=0.03). Few studies reported 
      the necessary data to allow us to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of specific BP 
      measurement methods or protocols. In three studies, automated oscillometric office 
      BP results showed a range of sensitivity (51%–68%) for elevated BP, defined by 
      manual mercury sphygmomanometry, but more consistent specificity (97%–98%) and 
      positive predictive value (PPV) (76%–84%). Three different diagnostic accuracy 
      studies examined the impact of recommended protocols on OBPM. In one study, a single 
      BP measurement had high sensitivity (0.95) but only moderate PPV (0.76) compared 
      with the average of second and third BP measurements. Two small studies in 
      normotensive subjects found that leg crossing elevated BP measurements within the 
      normal range and caffeine ingestion falsely elevated BP measurements above the 
      hypertensive threshold in 17% of normotensive participants. We first evaluated the 
      predictive value of home BP monitoring (HBPM) and ABPM methods for long-term CV 
      events compared with OBPM. Eleven studies reported that daytime, nighttime, and 
      24-hour ABPM predicted stroke and other fatal and nonfatal CV events independently 
      of OBPM. While the results of five studies suggest similar results for HBPM, too few 
      studies are available to draw firm conclusions. Evidence from one study comparing 
      HBPM with ABPM was insufficient to allow us to draw conclusions. Limited evidence 
      suggested that cardiovascular disease outcomes for the patient subgroup with 
      isolated clinic hypertension (elevated OBPM and normal ABPM) are more similar to 
      those of normotensive subjects at baseline than those with sustained hypertension. 
      The proportion of participants with an elevated BP measurement who are normotensive 
      upon confirmatory testing by ABPM (or HBPM) ranged from 5 to 65 percent across all 
      studies. This population has false-positive results when screened by OBPM methods, 
      or “isolated clinic hypertension.” Increasing baseline OBPM was associated with 
      increasing PPV for ABPM-confirmed hypertension. As a result, the likelihood of 
      misdiagnosis of hypertension based only on screening measurement is greater as 
      measurements approach the threshold for a diagnosis of hypertension. We did not 
      qualitatively detect any associations between reported race/ethnicity, sex, or 
      smoking. Estimates of the weighted mean incidence of hypertension at yearly 
      intervals less than 6 years were derived from a small number of studies (except at 5 
      years) with highly variable results at each interval. The weighted mean incidence at 
      5 years of 14 percent, for example, actually ranged from 2 to 28 percent. In the 
      small number of studies that used a separate confirmation step, a significant 
      proportion of apparent incident hypertension cases were not confirmed. Thus, overall 
      estimates at yearly intervals based on unconfirmed incident hypertension are likely 
      to be falsely high. Variation in incidence estimates across studies also likely 
      reflects differences in criteria for diagnosis, as well as differences in age, sex, 
      baseline BP, and obesity status of the populations studied. Hypertension incidence 
      increased as much as two- to four-fold between a younger (ages 18 to 40/45 years) 
      and older (ages 40/45 to 60/65) age group, respectively. Within-study hypertension 
      incidence consistently tripled when comparing participants with initial optimal 
      versus normal BP, and was approximately doubled in those with initial normal versus 
      high-normal BP. Incidence was generally higher in men than women, especially men in 
      younger populations. While incidence was also two-fold higher in overweight persons 
      and three-fold higher in obese persons compared with those of normal weight, it was 
      not increased in smokers compared with nonsmokers or former smokers. African 
      Americans had a consistently higher incidence of hypertension at rescreening than 
      white participants. Four trials found no significant differences in psychological 
      distress or quality of life after patients were labeled as hypertensive or 
      prehypertensive. One cohort study reported significantly increased absenteeism up to 
      4 years after labeling compared with the year before. Three cohort studies reported 
      significant sleep disturbances associated with ABPM use and one study reported that 
      a significant proportion of ABPM users experienced pain, skin irritation, and 
      overall discomfort. Discomfort and restrictions in daily activities were more 
      frequently reported with ABPM than HBPM in one study. LIMITATIONS: Despite recent 
      emphasis on the instability of single BP measurements and the need for multiple 
      valid measurements to assess a patient’s actual elevated BP exposure, high-quality 
      comparable diagnostic accuracy studies are not common. Given recent recognition of 
      the impact of overdiagnosis in many diseases, the widespread availability of 
      automated BP devices with variable performance, and the prevalence of essential 
      hypertension in the United States, further research is needed to guide primary care 
      clinicians and consumers. CONCLUSIONS: ABPM (24-hour, daytime, or nighttime) is a 
      better predictor of long-term CV outcomes than OBPM (usually manual 
      sphygmomanometry) and should be considered the reference standard for evaluating 
      noninvasive BP measurements. A small body of evidence suggests, but does not 
      confirm, that HBPM can serve as a similar predictor of outcomes. Initial screening 
      by office-based methods (manual sphygmomanometry or automated oscillometric devices) 
      variably predicts hypertension as defined by ABPM, resulting in a significant 
      population with isolated clinic hypertension. Limited evidence suggests that 
      patients with isolated clinic hypertension have outcomes that are more similar to 
      normotensive than hypertensive persons. Failure to confirm initial elevated OBPM 
      results may result in misdiagnosis and overtreatment. Limited evidence suggests that 
      repeated measurements and improved procedural control (e.g., by automation) may 
      improve the diagnostic accuracy of OBPM when used to screen for high BP or confirm a 
      diagnosis of hypertension. Studies of rescreening intervals at up to 6 years found a 
      higher incidence of hypertension overall and at shorter intervals for persons with 
      BP in the high-normal range, older adults, persons with an above normal BMI, and 
      African Americans. These studies showed much lower incidence at longer rescreening 
      intervals up to 6 years in persons without these risk factors.

TI  - Usability of Wearable Devices With a Novel Cardiac Force Index for Estimating the 
      Dynamic Cardiac Function: Observational Study.
PG  - e15331

AB  - BACKGROUND: Long-distance running can be a form of stress to the heart. 
      Technological improvements combined with the public's gradual turn toward mobile 
      health (mHealth), self-health, and exercise effectiveness have resulted in the 
      widespread use of wearable exercise products. The monitoring of dynamic cardiac 
      function changes during running and running performance should be further studied. 
      OBJECTIVE: We investigated the relationship between dynamic cardiac function changes 
      and finish time for 3000-meter runs. Using a wearable device based on a novel 
      cardiac force index (CFI), we explored potential correlations among 3000-meter 
      runners with stronger and weaker cardiac functions during running. METHODS: This 
      study used the American product BioHarness 3.0 (Zephyr Technology Corporation), 
      which can measure basic physiological parameters including heart rate, respiratory 
      rate, temperature, maximum oxygen consumption, and activity. We investigated the 
      correlations among new physiological parameters, including CFI = weight * activity / 
      heart rate, cardiac force ratio (CFR) = CFI of running / CFI of walking, and finish 
      times for 3000-meter runs. RESULTS: The results showed that waist circumference, 
      smoking, and CFI were the significant factors for qualifying in the 3000-meter run. 
      The prediction model was as follows: ln (3000 meters running performance pass 
      probability / fail results probability) = -2.702 - 0.096 × [waist circumference] - 
      1.827 × [smoke] + 0.020 × [ACi7]. If smoking and the ACi7 were controlled, 
      contestants with a larger waist circumference tended to fail the qualification based 
      on the formula above. If waist circumference and ACi7 were controlled, smokers 
      tended to fail more often than nonsmokers. Finally, we investigated a new 
      calculation method for monitoring cardiac status during exercise that uses the CFI 
      of walking for the runner as a reference to obtain the ratio between the cardiac 
      force of exercise and that of walking (CFR) to provide a standard for determining if 
      the heart is capable of exercise. A relationship is documented between the CFR and 
      the performance of 3000-meter runs in a healthy 22-year-old person. During the 
      running period, data are obtained while participant slowly runs 3000 meters, and the 
      relationship between the CFR and time is plotted. The runner's CFR varies with 
      changes in activity. Since the runner's acceleration increases, the CFR quickly 
      increases to an explosive peak, indicating the runner's explosive power. At this 
      period, the CFI revealed a 3-fold increase (CFR=3) in a strong heart. After a time 
      lapse, the CFR is approximately 2.5 during an endurance period until finishing the 
      3000-meter run. Similar correlation is found in a runner with a weak heart, with the 
      CFR at the beginning period being 4 and approximately 2.5 thereafter. CONCLUSIONS: 
      In conclusion, the study results suggested that measuring the real-time CFR changes 
      could be used in a prediction model for 3000-meter running performance.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Understanding causes and correlates of health loss among children and 
      adolescents can identify areas of success, stagnation, and emerging threats and 
      thereby facilitate effective improvement strategies. OBJECTIVE: To estimate 
      mortality and morbidity in children and adolescents from 1990 to 2017 by age and sex 
      in 195 countries and territories. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study 
      examined levels, trends, and spatiotemporal patterns of cause-specific mortality and 
      nonfatal health outcomes using standardized approaches to data processing and 
      statistical analysis. It also describes epidemiologic transitions by evaluating 
      historical associations between disease indicators and the Socio-Demographic Index 
      (SDI), a composite indicator of income, educational attainment, and fertility. Data 
      collected from 1990 to 2017 on children and adolescents from birth through 19 years 
      of age in 195 countries and territories were assessed. Data analysis occurred from 
      January 2018 to August 2018. EXPOSURES: Being under the age of 20 years between 1990 
      and 2017. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Death and disability. All-cause and 
      cause-specific deaths, disability-adjusted life years, years of life lost, and years 
      of life lived with disability. RESULTS: Child and adolescent deaths decreased 51.7% 
      from 13.77 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 13.60-13.93 million) in 1990 to 
      6.64 million (95% UI, 6.44-6.87 million) in 2017, but in 2017, aggregate disability 
      increased 4.7% to a total of 145 million (95% UI, 107-190 million) years lived with 
      disability globally. Progress was uneven, and inequity increased, with low-SDI and 
      low-middle-SDI locations experiencing 82.2% (95% UI, 81.6%-82.9%) of deaths, up from 
      70.9% (95% UI, 70.4%-71.4%) in 1990. The leading disaggregated causes of 
      disability-adjusted life years in 2017 in the low-SDI quintile were neonatal 
      disorders, lower respiratory infections, diarrhea, malaria, and congenital birth 
      defects, whereas neonatal disorders, congenital birth defects, headache, dermatitis, 
      and anxiety were highest-ranked in the high-SDI quintile. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: 
      Mortality reductions over this 27-year period mean that children are more likely 
      than ever to reach their 20th birthdays. The concomitant expansion of nonfatal 
      health loss and epidemiological transition in children and adolescents, especially 
      in low-SDI and middle-SDI countries, has the potential to increase already 
      overburdened health systems, will affect the human capital potential of societies, 
      and may influence the trajectory of socioeconomic development. Continued monitoring 
      of child and adolescent health loss is crucial to sustain the progress of the past 
      27 years.

AB  - No diagnostic biomarkers are available for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). 
      Here, we aimed to identify magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarkers for OCD, 
      using 46 data sets with 2304 OCD patients and 2068 healthy controls from the ENIGMA 
      consortium. We performed machine learning analysis of regional measures of cortical 
      thickness, surface area and subcortical volume and tested classification performance 
      using cross-validation. Classification performance for OCD vs. controls using the 
      complete sample with different classifiers and cross-validation strategies was poor. 
      When models were validated on data from other sites, model performance did not 
      exceed chance-level. In contrast, fair classification performance was achieved when 
      patients were grouped according to their medication status. These results indicate 
      that medication use is associated with substantial differences in brain anatomy that 
      are widely distributed, and indicate that clinical heterogeneity contributes to the 
      poor performance of structural MRI as a disease marker.
