abstract = {In the new electronic era, the increasing amounts of various resources make it more difficult to use information at workplace. Bring your own device (BYOD) makes employee in the business organization to handle these various information resources in the fashion way. BYOD, such as notebook and smart phone at work has become the usual and normal trend in the workplace. People deal their daily job with these devices. Trends such as the influx of workers' own devices into the workplace will require more flexible and creative management style in order to maintain the performance as usual. This study examined the theoretical framework guiding research on work design and psychological climate, consider context of BYOD, and evaluate evidence on the processes assumed to underlie these associations. The results provide support that psychological meaningfulness has significant influence on psychological safety which will positively contribute to job performance. Information processing positively contribute to psychological meaningfulness, while work-life conflict will sabotage the formation of psychological meaningfulness. Interaction outside organization is significantly related to psychological safety, while life-work conflict has a negative effect. The findings reveal that BYOD provides opportunities for employees to redefine their work. Instead of passively taking the work, employees can proactively determine the method and process of work with the BYOD.},

abstract = {In recent years, with the explosive adoption of smart phone devices, mobile health and fitness applications have been increasingly used by healthcare practitioners and the general public to manage electronic health records, chronic medical conditions, dietary references etc. Despite the rapid growth in the number of mobile and fitness applications on various platforms, very little work has been done to quantitatively and qualitatively assess these applications to guide users in the selection process. Automatic categorization of mobile health and fitness applications is the first step in this direction. In this paper, we report results from crawling 1,430 Android and 62,286 iOS apps in Nov. 2013. Among them, 1,399 apps were manually classified to one or multiple categories out of a total of 11 categories. Text mining tools were applied to the description section of the apps for keyword extraction, feature selection and automatic categorization. The classifiers we experimented with have comparable performance with Linear SVC achieving the highest precision, recall and f1 scores of 0.89, 0.79 and 0.88, respectively.},

abstract = {The autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is increasingly being recognized as a major public health issue which affects approximately 0.5--0.6% of the population. Promoting the general awareness of the disorder, increasing the engagement with the affected individuals and their carers, and understanding the success of penetration of the current clinical recommendations in the target communities, is crucial in driving research as well as policy. The aim of the present work is to investigate if Twitter, as a highly popular platform for information exchange, can be used as a data-mining source which could aid in the aforementioned challenges. Specifically, using a large data set of harvested tweets, we present a series of experiments which examine a range of linguistic and semantic aspects of messages posted by individuals interested in ASD. Our findings, the first of their nature in the published scientific literature, strongly motivate additional research on this topic and present a methodological basis for further work.},

publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {In social networking services (SNSs), persistent topics are extremely rare and valuable. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for the detection of persistent topics in SNSs based on Topic Graph. A topic graph is a subgraph of the ordinary social network graph that consists of the users who shared a certain topic up to some time point. Based on the assumption that the time-evolutions of the topic graphs associated with a persistent and non-persistent topics are different, we propose to detect persistent topics by performing anomaly detection on the feature values extracted from the time-evolution of the topic graph. For anomaly detection, we use principal component analysis to capture the subspace spanned by normal (non-persistent) topics. We demonstrate our technique on a real data set we gathered from Twitter and show that it performs significantly better than a base-line method based on power law curve fitting and the linear influence model.},

abstract = {Effect of mood and emotion on a person's behavior and his/her interactions with other people has been studied for a long time. Positivity and negativity of a person are two important attributes of emotion and mood. Social media is a very important platform from which we can glean the positivity and negativity attributes of a user based on his/her message postings and interactions with other users. In this paper, we study and analyze a Twitter dataset of more than 130,000 users to understand the nature of their positivity and negativity attributes. We measure behavioral attributes by sentiment analysis relating to social personal concern and psychological process. We observe that social media contains useful behavioral cues to classify users into positive and negative groups based on network density and degree of social activity either in information sharing or emotional interaction and social awareness. We believe that our findings will be useful in developing tools for predicting positive and negative users and help provide the best recommendation towards helping negative users through online social media.},

abstract = {Accurate knowledge of a patient's disease state and trajectory is critical in a clinical setting. Modern electronic healthcare records contain an increasingly large amount of data, and the ability to automatically identify the factors that influence patient outcomes stand to greatly improve the efficiency and quality of care.We examined the use of latent variable models (viz. Latent Dirichlet Allocation) to decompose free-text hospital notes into meaningful features, and the predictive power of these features for patient mortality. We considered three prediction regimes: (1) baseline prediction, (2) dynamic (time-varying) outcome prediction, and (3) retrospective outcome prediction. In each, our prediction task differs from the familiar time-varying situation whereby data accumulates; since fewer patients have long ICU stays, as we move forward in time fewer patients are available and the prediction task becomes increasingly difficult.We found that latent topic-derived features were effective in determining patient mortality under three timelines: in-hospital, 30 day post-discharge, and 1 year post-discharge mortality. Our results demonstrated that the latent topic features important in predicting hospital mortality are very different from those that are important in post-discharge mortality. In general, latent topic features were more predictive than structured features, and a combination of the two performed best.The time-varying models that combined latent topic features and baseline features had AUCs that reached 0.85, 0.80, and 0.77 for in-hospital, 30 day post-discharge and 1 year post-discharge mortality respectively. Our results agreed with other work suggesting that the first 24 hours of patient information are often the most predictive of hospital mortality. Retrospective models that used a combination of latent topic features and structured features achieved AUCs of 0.96, 0.82, and 0.81 for in-hospital, 30 day, and 1-year mortality prediction.Our work focuses on the dynamic (time-varying) setting because models from this regime could facilitate an on-going severity stratification system that helps direct care-staff resources and inform treatment strategies.},

abstract = {Chronic diseases, such as Alzheimer's Disease, Diabetes, and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, usually progress slowly over a long period of time, causing increasing burden to the patients, their families, and the healthcare system. A better understanding of their progression is instrumental in early diagnosis and personalized care. Modeling disease progression based on real-world evidence is a very challenging task due to the incompleteness and irregularity of the observations, as well as the heterogeneity of the patient conditions. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic disease progression model that address these challenges. As compared to existing disease progression models, the advantage of our model is three-fold: 1) it learns a continuous-time progression model from discrete-time observations with non-equal intervals; 2) it learns the full progression trajectory from a set of incomplete records that only cover short segments of the progression; 3) it learns a compact set of medical concepts as the bridge between the hidden progression process and the observed medical evidence, which are usually extremely sparse and noisy. We demonstrate the capabilities of our model by applying it to a real-world COPD patient cohort and deriving some interesting clinical insights.},

abstract = {Online platforms, such as Meetup and Plancast, have recently become popular for planning gatherings and event organization. However, there is a surprising lack of studies on how to effectively and efficiently organize social events for a large group of people through such platforms. In this paper, we study the key computational problem involved in organization of social events, to our best knowledge, for the first time.We propose the Social Event Organization (SEO) problem as one of assigning a set of events for a group of users to attend, where the users are socially connected with each other and have innate levels of interest in those events. As a first step toward Social Event Organization, we introduce a formal definition of a restricted version of the problem and show that it is NP-hard and is hard to approximate. We propose efficient heuristic algorithms that improve upon simple greedy algorithms by incorporating the notion of phantom events and by using look-ahead estimation. Using synthetic datasets and three real datasets including those from the platforms Meetup and Plancast, we experimentally demonstrate that our greedy heuristics are scalable and furthermore outperform the baseline algorithms significantly in terms of achieving superior social welfare.},

abstract = {In many applications, classification labels may not be associated with a single instance of records, but may be associated with a data set of records. The class behavior may not be possible to infer effectively from a single record, but may be only be inferred by an aggregate set of records. Therefore, in this problem, the class label is associated with a set of instances both in the training and test data. Therefore, the problem may be understood to be that of classifying a set of data sets. Typically, the classification behavior may only be inferred from the overall patterns of data distribution, and very little information is embedded in any given record for classification purposes. We refer to this problem as the setwise classification problem.The problem can be extremely challenging in scenarios where the data is received in the form of a stream, and the records within any particular data set may not necessarily be received contiguously. In this paper, we present a first approach for real time and streaming classification of such data. We present experimental results illustrating the effectiveness of the approach.},

abstract = {To achieve high performance on many-core architectures like GPUs, it is crucial to efficiently utilize the available memory bandwidth. Currently, it is common to use fast, on-chip scratchpad memories, like the shared memory available on GPUs' shader cores, to buffer data for computation. This buffering, however, has some sources of inefficiency that hinder it from most efficiently utilizing the available memory resources. These issues stem from shader resources being used for repeated, regular address calculations, a need to shuffle data multiple times between a physically unified on-chip memory, and forcing all threads to synchronize to ensure RAW consistency based on the speed of the slowest threads. To address these inefficiencies, we propose Data-Parallel DMA, or D2MA. D2MA is a reimagination of traditional DMA that addresses the challenges of extending DMA to thousands of concurrently executing threads. D2MA de-couples address generation from the shader's computational resources, provides a more direct and efficient path for data in global memory to travel into the shared memory, and introduces a novel dynamic synchronization scheme that is transparent to the programmer. These advancements allow D2MA to achieve speedups as high as 2.29x, and reduces the average time to buffer data by 81% on average.},

abstract = {Touch-sensitive surfaces have become a predominant input medium for computing devices. In particular, multitouch capability of these devices has given rise to developing rich interaction vocabularies for “real” direct manipulation of user interfaces. However, the richness and flexibility of touch interaction often comes with significant complexity for programming these behaviors. Particularly, finger touches, though intuitive, are imprecise and lead to ambiguity. Touch input often involves coordinated movements of multiple fingers as opposed to the single pointer of a traditional WIMP interface. It is challenging in not only detecting the intended motion carried out by these fingers but also in determining the target objects being manipulated due to multiple focus points. Currently, developers often need to build touch behaviors by dealing with raw touch events that is effort consuming and error-prone. In this article, we present Touch, a tool that allows developers to easily specify their desired touch behaviors by demonstrating them live on a touch-sensitive device or selecting them from a list of common behaviors. Developers can then integrate these touch behaviors into their application as resources and via an API exposed by our runtime framework. The integrated tool support enables developers to think and program optimistically about how these touch interactions should behave, without worrying about underlying complexity and technical details in detecting target behaviors and invoking application logic. We discuss the design of several novel inference algorithms that underlie these tool supports and evaluate them against a multitouch dataset that we collected from end users. We also demonstrate the usefulness of our system via an example application.},

abstract = {Data partitioning is a critical operation for manipulating large datasets because it subdivides tasks into pieces that are more amenable to efficient processing. It is often the limiting factor in database performance and represents a significant fraction of the overall runtime of large data queries. This article measures the performance and energy of state-of-the-art software partitioners, and describes and evaluates a hardware range partitioner that further improves efficiency.The software implementation is broken into two phases, allowing separate analysis of the partition function computation and data shuffling costs. Although range partitioning is commonly thought to be more expensive than simpler strategies such as hash partitioning, our measurements indicate that careful data movement and optimization of the partition function can allow it to approach the throughput and energy consumption of hash or radix partitioning.For further acceleration, we describe a hardware range partitioner, or HARP, a streaming framework that offers a seamless execution environment for this and other streaming accelerators, and a detailed analysis of a 32nm physical design that matches the throughput of four to eight software threads while consuming just 6.9% of the area and 4.3% of the power of a Xeon core in the same technology generation.},

abstract = {The success of a society is often judged by its ability to support the most vulnerable. Supporting the most vulnerable individuals is extremely challenging from an information needs perspective, since it requires data from numerous domains and systems, including Social Care, Healthcare, Public Safety and Juridical systems. Information sharing on this scale gives rise to scientific and technical challenges with regard to data representation, access, integration and retrieval granularity. This is a practice-oriented paper presenting a Linked Data-based approach that is uniquely positioned to access and surface information across domains and data sources using a combination of vulnerability indexes and contextual exploration. We apply this approach on a set of enterprise systems from IBM to develop an information sharing architecture and prototype for Care Coordination with a focus on Social Care and Healthcare. We report on expert feedback and user studies that indicate that our approach indeed reduces the time required to gain some business insight while maintaining the flexibility of a Linked Data-based integration approach.},

abstract = {When providing directions to a place, web and mobile mapping services are all able to suggest the shortest route. The goal of this work is to automatically suggest routes that are not only short but also emotionally pleasant. To quantify the extent to which urban locations are pleasant, we use data from a crowd-sourcing platform that shows two street scenes in London (out of hundreds), and a user votes on which one looks more beautiful, quiet, and happy. We consider votes from more than 3.3K individuals and translate them into quantitative measures of location perceptions. We arrange those locations into a graph upon which we learn pleasant routes. Based on a quantitative validation, we find that, compared to the shortest routes, the recommended ones add just a few extra walking minutes and are indeed perceived to be more beautiful, quiet, and happy. To test the generality of our approach, we consider Flickr metadata of more than 3.7M pictures in London and 1.3M in Boston, compute proxies for the crowdsourced beauty dimension (the one for which we have collected the most votes), and evaluate those proxies with 30 participants in London and 54 in Boston. These participants have not only rated our recommendations but have also carefully motivated their choices, providing insights for future work.},

We formalize the top-k nearest neighbor problem for uncertain data series, and describe a model for uncertain data series that captures both uncertainty and correlation. This distinguishes our approach from prior work that compromises the accuracy of the model by assuming independence of the value distribution at neighboring time-stamps. We introduce the Holistic-PkNN algorithm, which uses novel metric bounds for uncertain series and an efficient refinement strategy to reduce the overall number of required probability estimates. We evaluate our proposal under a variety of settings using a combination of synthetic and 45 real datasets from diverse domains. The results demonstrate the significant advantages of the proposed approach.},

In this paper the SemCCM system that utilizes the state of the art Semantic Web tools, methods and datasets for automatic semantic annotation of LMS courses is presented. The SemCCM system complements the LMSs through extraction and ranking of the relevant DBpedia resources for each of the courses, and uses their Wikipedia categories for more general area determination. The extracted DBpedia resources, together with their categories represent the specific topics covered by the courses and provide more accurate course retrieval. Together with the users' completed courses, the extracted DBpedia resources are used for determination of the users' competencies. The SemCCM system presents the analysis results to the end users in several different perspectives, enabling semantically enhanced course and user search, graph based course and competence overview, as well as user comparison.},

This article reports on qualitative and quantitative research to comprehend the strategies, tools, and knowledge used for program comprehension. We observed 28 professional developers, focusing on their comprehension behavior, strategies followed, and tools used. In an online survey with 1,477 respondents, we analyzed the importance of certain types of knowledge for comprehension and where developers typically access and share this knowledge.We found that developers follow pragmatic comprehension strategies depending on context. They try to avoid comprehension whenever possible and often put themselves in the role of users by inspecting graphical interfaces. Participants confirmed that standards, experience, and personal communication facilitate comprehension. The team size, its distribution, and open-source experience influence their knowledge sharing and access behavior. While face-to-face communication is preferred for accessing knowledge, knowledge is frequently shared in informal comments.Our results reveal a gap between research and practice, as we did not observe any use of comprehension tools and developers seem to be unaware of them. Overall, our findings call for reconsidering the research agendas towards context-aware tool support.},

abstract = {Security and usability issues with pass-locks on mobile devices have prompted researchers to develop implicit authentication (IA) schemes, which continuously and transparently authenticate users using behavioural biometrics. Contemporary IA schemes proposed by the research community are challenging to deploy, and there is a need for a framework that supports: different behavioural classifiers, given that different apps have different requirements; app developers using IA without becoming domain experts; and real-time classification on resource-constrained mobile devices. We present Itus, an IA framework for Android that allows the research community to improve IA schemes incrementally, while allowing app developers to adopt these improvements at their own pace.We describe the Itus framework and how it provides: ease of use: Itus allows app developers to use IA by changing as few as two lines of their existing code - on the other hand, Itus provides an oracle capable of making advanced recommendations should developers wish to fine-tune the classifiers; flexibility: developers can deploy Itus in an application-specific manner, adapting to their unique needs; extensibility: researchers can contribute new behavioural features and classifiers without worrying about deployment particulars; low performance overhead: Itus operates with minimal performance overhead, allowing app developers to deploy it without compromising end-user experience. These goals are accomplished with an API allowing individual stakeholders to incrementally improve Itus without re-engineering new systems. We implement Itus in two demo apps and measure its performance impact. To our knowledge, Itus is the first open-source extensible IA framework for Android that can be deployed off-the-shelf.},

Every test input needs to be run with a variety of contexts, such as: device heterogeneity, wireless network speeds, locations, and unpredictable sensor inputs. The range of values for each context, e.g. location, can be very large. In this paper we present Caiipa, a cloud service for testing apps over an expanded mobile context space in a scalable way. It incorporates key techniques to make app testing more tractable, including a context test space prioritizer to quickly discover failure scenarios for each app. We have implemented Caiipa on a cluster of VMs and real devices that can each emulate various combinations of contexts for tablet and phone apps. We evaluate Caiipa by testing 265 commercially available mobile apps based on a comprehensive library of real-world conditions. Our results show that Caiipa leads to improvements of 11.1x and 8.4x in the number of crashes and performance bugs discovered compared to conventional UI-based automation (i.e., monkey-testing).},

This article presents a lightweight algorithm for online load adaptation of energy-harvesting sensor nodes using supercapacitors as energy buffers. The algorithm capitalizes on the elementary relationship between state of charge and voltage that is characteristic for supercapacitors. It is particularly designed to handle the nonlinear system model, and it is lightweight enough to run on low-power sensor node hardware. We define two energy policies, evaluate their performance using real-world solar-harvesting traces, and analyze the influence of the supercapacitor’s capacity and imprecisions in harvest forecasts. To show the practical merit of our algorithm, we devise a load adaptation scheme for multihop data collection sensor networks and run a 4-week field test. The results show that (i) choosing a duty cycle a priori is infeasible, (ii) our algorithm increases the achievable work load of a node when using forecasts, (iii) uniform and steady operation is achieved, and (iv) depletion can be prevented in most cases.},

abstract = {Insider threat damages vary from intellectual property loss and fraud to IT sabotage. As insider threat incidents have evolved to cause potentially catastrophic damages, there exists a need for a detection mechanism in order to build solutions that prevent such threats. Studies over the years show an understanding of the threat, and many approaches have been suggested to detect it, yet none of the approaches targets the physiological aspect of the threat. Bio-signals are impossible to mimic or change, as opposed to behavioral approaches. In this paper, we investigate the use of physiological signals as a measurement to detect insider threat. We design an insider threat monitoring system called Physiological Signals Monitoring (PSM) that detects incidents seconds before they occur. The main measurement in PSM is the abnormal deviation rate of electrocardiogram (ECG) amplitude, Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) and skin temperature that occurs seconds before an incident is executed. Our experiment on 15 human subjects explores this new area and shows the promise of the proposed solution with all of the tested incidents being correctly classified with Nearest Neighbor and Functional Trees classifiers.},

Many examples can be given; one of them is BitBucket which encountered a denial of service attack (based on Amazon Cloud infrastructure) and led to 19 hours outage [6]. Bearing in mind the importance of the Cyber security and the factors that play a major role, the human factor was recognized as one of the most important.For this reason, this paper focuses on the application of safety techniques to the Cyber domain. More specifically it investigates the possibility of a successful implementation of the Situation Awareness theory into a Networking Environment. By concentrating on the Network Intrusion Detection Systems and the human factor involved (Network Administrators / IT specialists), it is attempted to propose a procedure that can identify the influence level of the human factor's awareness in the case of an attack to the system.In order to explain this approach the theory of Situation Awareness and its characteristics will be introduced. Moreover the most known Situation Awareness Measurement Techniques will be presented and their adoption to the Cyber domain will be discussed. There is a lack of research in the Situation Awareness Measurement Techniques for a network system which leads to the need for further exploration.},

abstract = {Ubiquity of portable location-aware devices and popularity of online location-based services, have recently given rise to the collection of datasets with high spatial and temporal resolution. The subject of analyzing such data has consequently gained popularity due to numerous opportunities enabled by understanding objects' (people and animals, among others) mobility patterns. In this paper, we propose a hidden semi-Markov-based model to understand the behavior of mobile entities. The hierarchical state structure in our model allows capturing spatio-temporal associations in the locational history both at stay-points and on the paths connecting them. We compare the accuracy of our model with a number of other spatio-temporal models using two real datasets. Furthermore, we perform sensitivity analysis on our model to evaluate its robustness in presence of common issues in mobility datasets such as existence of noise and missing values. Results of our experiments show superiority of the proposed scheme compared with the other models.},

The StudentLife continuous sensing app assesses the day-to-day and week-by-week impact of workload on stress, sleep, activity, mood, sociability, mental well-being and academic performance of a single class of 48 students across a 10 week term at Dartmouth College using Android phones. Results from the StudentLife study show a number of significant correlations between the automatic objective sensor data from smartphones and mental health and educational outcomes of the student body. We also identify a Dartmouth term lifecycle in the data that shows students start the term with high positive affect and conversation levels, low stress, and healthy sleep and daily activity patterns. As the term progresses and the workload increases, stress appreciably rises while positive affect, sleep, conversation and activity drops off. The StudentLife dataset is publicly available on the web.},

abstract = {Health sensing through smartphones has received considerable attention in recent years because of the devices' ubiquity and promise to lower the barrier for tracking medical conditions. In this paper, we focus on using smartphones to monitor newborn jaundice, which manifests as a yellow discoloration of the skin. Although a degree of jaundice is common in healthy newborns, early detection of extreme jaundice is essential to prevent permanent brain damage or death. Current detection techniques, however, require clinical tests with blood samples or other specialized equipment. Consequently, newborns often depend on visual assessments of their skin color at home, which is known to be unreliable. To this end, we present BiliCam, a low-cost system that uses smartphone cameras to assess newborn jaundice. We evaluated BiliCam on 100 newborns, yielding a 0.85 rank order correlation with the gold standard blood test. We also discuss usability challenges and design solutions to make the system practical.},

abstract = {The mobile phone represents a unique platform for interactive applications that can harness the opportunity of an immediate contact with a user in order to increase the impact of the delivered information. However, this accessibility does not necessarily translate to reachability, as recipients might refuse an initiated contact or disfavor a message that comes in an inappropriate moment.In this paper we seek to answer whether, and how, suitable moments for interruption can be identified and utilized in a mobile system. We gather and analyze a real-world smartphone data trace and show that users' broader context, including their activity, location, time of day, emotions and engagement, determine different aspects of interruptibility. We then design and implement InterruptMe, an interruption management library for Android smartphones. An extensive experiment shows that, compared to a context-unaware approach, interruptions elicited through our library result in increased user satisfaction and shorter response times.},

In the current medical practice, the change is induced through tailored coaching, support and information delivery. However, with the advent of smartphones, innovative ways of delivering interventions are emerging. Indeed, mobile phones, equipped with an array of sensors, and carried by their users at all times, enable therapists to both learn about the user behaviour, and impact the behaviour through the delivery of more relevant and personalised information. In this work we propose harnessing pervasive computing to not only learn from users' past behaviour, but also predict future actions and emotional states, deliver interventions proactively, evaluate their impact at run-time, and over time learn a personal intervention-effect model of a participant.},

abstract = {Mobile phones include a variety of sensors that can be used to develop context-aware applications and gather data about the user's behavior, including the places he visits, his level of activity and how frequently and with whom he socializes. The collection and analysis of these data has been the focus of recent attention in ubiquitous computing, giving rise to the field known as mobile sensing. In this work, we present a collaborative extension to InCense, a toolkit to facilitate behavioral data gathering from populations of mobile phone users. InCense aims at providing people with little or no technical background with a tool that assists in the rapid design and implementation of mobile phone sensing campaigns. By extending the architecture of InCense to support distributed sensing campaigns we are able to incorporate several strategies aimed at optimizing battery, storage, and bandwidth. These issues represent significant challenges in sensing campaigns that generate considerable amounts of data (i.e., collecting audio) or quickly drain the battery in the device (i.e., GPS), given the limitations of mobile devices. In this work, collaborative sensing is used to decide which mobile phone should capture audio when two or more devices are potentially recording a similar audio signal.},

Although the data generated is incredibly useful, state-of-the-art feedback technologies are often limited to either providing an overall status or serving large volume of multi-dimensional sensor data with little processing. My research falls into filling this gap. I work on developing systems that use sensors to understand different dimensions of well being, and subsequently devise interventions through personalized and actionable suggestions. Using simple machine learning techniques, my systems automatically mine user behaviors that influence specific well-being dimensions. Then utilizing decision theory and behavioral psychology theory, my systems create personalized actionable suggestions that are related to existing user's behaviors. In this proposal, I describe how I realize such automated systems for sensing and providing feedback.},

This paper particularly focuses on dogs in kenneled accommodation, as we investigate the opportunities and challenges for a smart kennel aiming to foster canine welfare. We conducted an in-depth ethnographic study of a dog rehoming center over four months; based on our findings, we propose a welfare-centered framework for designing smart environments, integrating monitoring and interaction with information management. We discuss the methodological issues we encountered during the research and propose a smart ethnographic approach for similar projects.},

abstract = {Wearable wireless sensors for health monitoring are enabling the design and delivery of just-in-time interventions (JITI). Critical to the success of JITI is to time its delivery so that the user is available to be engaged. We take a first step in modeling users' availability by analyzing 2,064 hours of physiological sensor data and 2,717 self-reports collected from 30 participants in a week-long field study. We use delay in responding to a prompt to objectively measure availability. We compute 99 features and identify 30 as most discriminating to train a machine learning model for predicting availability. We find that location, affect, activity type, stress, time, and day of the week, play significant roles in predicting availability. We find that users are least available at work and during driving, and most available when walking outside. Our model finally achieves an accuracy of 74.7% in 10-fold cross-validation and 77.9% with leave-one-subject-out.},

Sensors networks have emerged in the last decade as a possible solution to older adult health monitoring and early illness recognition. Typical early illness recognition approaches are either concentrated on the detection of a given set of activities such as a fall or walks, or on the detection of anomalies such as too many bathroom visits. In this paper we propose a new illness recognition framework, MFA, based on detecting a missing frequent activity from the daily routine. MFA is implemented using a frequent temporal pattern detection algorithm and demonstrated on a pilot dataset collected in TigerPlace, an aging in place community from Columbia, Missouri.},

abstract = {Sleep quality plays a significant role in personal health. A great deal of effort has been paid to design sleep quality monitoring systems, providing services ranging from bedtime monitoring to sleep activity detection. However, as sleep quality is closely related to the distribution of sleep duration over different sleep stages, neither the bedtime nor the intensity of sleep activities is able to reflect sleep quality precisely. To this end, we present Sleep Hunter, a mobile service that provides a fine-grained detection of sleep stage transition for sleep quality monitoring and intelligent wake-up call. The rationale is that each sleep stage is accompanied by specific yet distinguishable body movements and acoustic signals. Leveraging the built-in sensors on smartphones, Sleep Hunter integrates these physical activities with sleep environment, inherent temporal relation and personal factors by a statistical model for a fine-grained sleep stage detection. Based on the duration of each sleep stage, Sleep Hunter further provides sleep quality report and smart call service for users. Experimental results from over 30 sets of nocturnal sleep data show that our system is superior to existing actigraphy-based sleep quality monitoring systems, and achieves satisfying detection accuracy compared with dedicated polysomnography-based devices.},

abstract = {Furniture is the building block of the spaces we inhabit. Its design and its functions shape how we use spaces, as individuals and as groups. While being an integral part of our lives, furniture is unaware of what happens around it. But what if furniture could change its appearance? What situations should it respond to? How might it communicate its state to those around it? Can we use emotional expression for such communication? To find and explore roles for interactive furniture in domestic spaces, we built EmotoCouch: a provocative prototype that uses combinations of color, patterns, and haptics designed to convey emotions. We gathered feedback to the concept of an emotional couch from an online study with 138 participants and in a laboratory study with 14 parent-child pairs. Our findings identify promising future directions, use cases, and opportunities for the use of emotion for expressive communication by furniture.},

abstract = {Consumer electronic devices like smartphones increasingly feature arrays of sensors that can 'see', 'hear', and 'feel' the environment around them. While these devices began with primitive capabilities, newer generations of electronics offer sophisticated sensing arrays that collect high-fidelity representations of the physical world. For example, wearable cameras are becoming more prevalent with new consumer lifelogging products including the Narrative Clip, Autographer, and Google Glass. These wearable cameras give computing devices a persistent sense of sight, raising important concerns about protecting people's privacy. At the same time, these devices also provide opportunities for enhancing security, by allowing trusted devices to observe and react to the physical environment surrounding the user and the device. We propose Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) to mediate access to sensors and their data using attributes of the context and content of sensor information. Attributes extracted from sensor data could be used to trigger policy actions ranging from sharing or not sharing images, to invoking system changes in reaction to outside visual stimuli such as automatically shutting down network interfaces when in the presence of unknown people. While prior work has addressed some specific actions, like preventing potentially private images from being shared based on their location, in this paper we present and advocate for a more general working definition of ABAC that applies to sensors and sensor data. We also present use cases for how this reactive security approach may help protect the privacy and security of users.},

Twiny is an elastic bracelet that gathers physical parameters through sensors: connecting emotions to physical state, Twiny gives the possibility to learn how to control mood, organizing time and trying to make people feel comfortable. Matching feelings data with calendar and health state, Twiny is able to build a grid of feelings, suggesting how to react to a bad mood or, for instance a constant migraine. Twiny attempts to correlate data down to every physical rash caused from stress to the body. Making people aware of their unconscious feelings will help them build a better lifestyle. Twiny, which wirelessly sends data to an application, allows users to control their own parameters every time they need.},

To identify the effect of visual displacement on simulator sickness, we examined the effect of visual displacement conditions (ranging from 50 to 300 mm) on simulator sickness and investigated the adaptation of simulator sickness over three days. The results indicated that the total symptom score of simulator sickness in the 300 mm visual displacement condition was significantly higher than that of simulator sickness in the other visual displacement conditions. In addition, the total symptom score of simulator sickness became significantly lower over 1--3 days in the 200 mm visual displacement condition and 1--2 days in the 300 mm visual displacement condition, which means that adaptation was found over three days. However, only partial adaptation was shown in the visual displacement 300, thereby suggesting that high sensory conflict in visual displacement 300 results in increased time to adapt. These results indicate that simulator sickness in video see-through HMDs are adaptable over time, which supports previous studies.},

abstract = {Data is growing. We are all aware of this in the IT industry, it is a common mantra. The elephant in the room is the ownership of that data and the use of that data. As with many new technologies, its legal and personal implications are not well understood until the technology has matured. Data ownership has by default resided with organisations that hold the data; utility companies, websites, retailers and data aggregators and brokers. If data could be owned by the people it identifies, the data handlers would have to pay to use that data for sales and marketing purposes. We are not suggesting payment would be the mostly illusory free services and hidden discounts that are the current answer but real money or an asset that can be bartered or purchased. If even the poorest people can gain an income this would revolutionise personal finance for those who register on the web either for purchases or to make their name available for use. We propose such a revolution in data ownership and urge all data generators to establish their rights to a business asset that they frequently gift to already wealthy organisations. Don't be a mere generator of data, become a personal data aggregator, collecting and controlling all your data. Time to man the barricades against entities who are using your data for their profit and pleasure, not yours.},

Our approach utilizes topic clustering, classification, and association rules to identify meaningful groupings of feature requests and then uses them to guide the construction of personas. Once created, these personas are leveraged to coordinate feature requests, track changes, and to provide stakeholder communication mechanisms. We illustrate our approach with examples taken from the health-insurance domain and then evaluate it against feature requests in the SugarCRM project.},

abstract = {The security community spares no effort in emphasizing security awareness and the importance of building secure software. However, the number of new vulnerabilities found in today's systems is still increasing. Furthermore, old and well-studied vulnerability types such as buffer overflows and SQL injections, are still repeatedly reported in vulnerability databases. Historically, the common response has been to blame the developers for their lack of security education. This paper discusses a new hypothesis to explain this problem by introducing a new security paradigm where software vulnerabilities are viewed as developers' blind spots in their decision making. We argue that such a flawed mental process is heuristic-based, where humans solve problems without considering all the information available, just like taking shortcuts. This paper's thesis is that security thinking tends to be left out by developers during their programming, as vulnerabilities usually exist in corner cases with unusual information flows. Leveraging this paradigm, this paper introduces a novel methodology for capturing and understanding security-related blind spots in Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). Finally, it discusses how this methodology can be applied to the design and implementation of the next generation of automated diagnosis tools.},

abstract = {Risk assessment in information security traditionally analyzes threats to assets. An asset is a persistent item or property of value and has an owner. Attacks damage assets; security controls prevent attacks to preserve their value. Expected attack loss is calculated from the value of the attacked assets. This common analytic approach works satisfyingly if an IT system runs in an enclosed environment within an organization. Nowadays, IT systems are accessed and used across organizational boundaries by a multitude of independent stakeholders employing them for their own interests and with particular expectations regarding their trustworthiness. The asset paradigm cannot support estimating consequences of security incidents that may harm these complex stakeholder collaborations. We propose to model the stakeholder collaboration networks and to analyze scenarios of how security incidents affect relationships between stakeholders. Collaboration continuously creates value for all participants. Security incidents change the behavior of stakeholders and their willingness to collaborate, but in complicated ways. Transmission factors characterizing a relationship help us to assess the impact of incidents. We apply the conventional method and our new approach to a case study and compare the results.},

abstract = {Urbanization's rapid progress has modernized many people's lives but also engendered big issues, such as traffic congestion, energy consumption, and pollution. Urban computing aims to tackle these issues by using the data that has been generated in cities (e.g., traffic flow, human mobility, and geographical data). Urban computing connects urban sensing, data management, data analytics, and service providing into a recurrent process for an unobtrusive and continuous improvement of people's lives, city operation systems, and the environment. Urban computing is an interdisciplinary field where computer sciences meet conventional city-related fields, like transportation, civil engineering, environment, economy, ecology, and sociology in the context of urban spaces. This article first introduces the concept of urban computing, discussing its general framework and key challenges from the perspective of computer sciences. Second, we classify the applications of urban computing into seven categories, consisting of urban planning, transportation, the environment, energy, social, economy, and public safety and security, presenting representative scenarios in each category. Third, we summarize the typical technologies that are needed in urban computing into four folds, which are about urban sensing, urban data management, knowledge fusion across heterogeneous data, and urban data visualization. Finally, we give an outlook on the future of urban computing, suggesting a few research topics that are somehow missing in the community.},

The performance of this module was evaluated on sentences from personal stories about life experiences. The developed web-based interface supports recognition of nine emotions, positive and negative judgments, and positive and negative appreciations conveyed in text. It allows users to adjust parameters, to enable or disable various functionality components of the algorithm, and to select the format of text annotation and attitude statistics visualization.},

abstract = {Context. Many reports support the fact that some psycho--social aspects of software engineers are key factors for the quality of the software development process and its resulting products. Based on the experience of some of the authors after more than a year of practising mindfulness---a meditation technique aimed to increase clearness of mind and awareness---we guessed that it could be interesting to empirically evaluate whether mindfulness affects positively not only the behaviour but also the professional performance of software engineers.Goal. In this paper, we present a quasi--experiment carried out at the University of Seville to evaluate whether Software Engineering &amp; Information Systems students enhance their conceptual modelling skills after the continued daily practice of mindfulness during four weeks.Method. Students were divided into two groups: one group practised mindfulness, and the other---the control group---were trained in public speaking. In order to study the possible cause--and--effect relationship, effectiveness (the rate of model elements correctly identified) and efficiency (the number of model elements correctly identified per unit of time) of the students developing conceptual modelling exercises were measured before and after taking the mindfulness and public speaking sessions.Results. The experiment results have revealed that the students who practised mindfulness have become more efficient in developing conceptual models than those who attended the public speaking sessions. With respect to effectiveness, some enhancement have been observed, although not as significant as in the case of efficiency.Conclusions. This rising trend in effectiveness suggests that the number of sessions could have been insufficient and that a longer period of sessions could have also enhanced effectiveness significantly.},

abstract = {Context: To software architects (SAs), the quality requirements (QRs) to a software system are key to designing the software architecture. However, understanding SAs' roles in the QRs engineering activities only recently became a topic in empirical requirements engineering research and very little is still known about QRs engineering from SAs' in large and distributed projects. Goal: This exploratory study aims at explicating how SAs are involved in engineering QRs in a specific distributed development setting, namely in organizations that distribute software development activities to closely located business units, known as near-shore development centres (NDCs), and in a specific geographic zone, namely Eastern Europe. Method: Based on interviews with 16 practitioners working on large projects in NDCs, we explicate the participation and involvement of NDCs' architects in QRs tasks. Results: We found that SAs from NDCs (i) are actively involved in QRs documentation and validation, (ii) are relatively passive participants in QRs elicitation and prioritization, and (iii) are not at all involved in QRs negotiation. Perhaps, our most surprising finding is that NDCs may often have economic incentives to misalign with onshore QRs practices. Conclusions: We explicated QRs practices, compared them to previously published ones, and found implications for both researchers and practitioners. Though, our results are preliminary, as they are from an exploratory study.},

As the synaptic vesicles have a major role in nervous signal transportation in synapses, their distribution in relationship to the active zone is very important in studying the neuron responses. We study the effect of stress on brain functionality by statistically modelling the distribution of the synaptic vesicles in two groups of rats: a control group subjected to sham stress and a stressed group subjected to a single acute foot-shock (FS)-stress episode.We hypothesize that the synaptic vesicles have different spatial distributions in the two groups. The spatial distributions are modelled using spatial point process models with an inhomogeneous conditional intensity and repulsive pair-wise interactions. Our results verify the hypothesis that the two groups have different spatial distributions.},

Among the types of swarming, one in which the complete abandonment of the hive occurs, has created large losses to Brazilian beekeepers, especially the Northeast. In an attempt to mitigate this problem, we propose in this paper a system for monitoring hive, via a wireless sensors network capable of identifying the preswarming colony behavior. Through a pattern of collections obtained from the cyclical behavior daily temperatures, we developed a predictive algorithm based on pattern recognition techniques, able to detect the increase in temperature in the hive (microclimate) responsible for the typical stress of bees that culminates in swarming. This mechanism is also able to recognize and avoid sending redundant information over the network in order to reduce radio communication, thereby reducing costs of data transmission and energy.},

During the last decade, several studies have discussed pros and cons of lab and field evaluations. Based on these discussions, we conduct a review to explore the past decade of mobile HCI research on field and lab evaluation, investigating responses in the literature to the "is it worth the hassle?" paper from 2004. We find that while our knowledge and experience with both lab and field studies have grown considerably, there is still no definite answer to the lab versus field question. In response we suggest that the real question is not if -- but when and how -- to go into the field. In response we suggest moving beyond usability evaluations, and to engage with field studies that are truly in-the-wild, and longitudinal.},

abstract = {Research suggests smartphone users face 'application overload', but literature lacks an in-depth investigation of how users manage their time on smartphones. In a 3-week study we collected smartphone application usage patterns from 21 participants to study how they manage their time interacting with the device. We identified events we term application micro-usage: brief bursts of interaction with applications. While this practice has been reported before, it has not been investigated in terms of the context in which it occurs (e.g., location, time, trigger and social context). In a 2-week follow-up study with 15 participants, we captured participants? context while micro-using, with a mobile experience sampling method (ESM) and weekly interviews. Our results show that about approximately 40% of application launches last less than 15 seconds and happen most frequently when the user is at home and alone. We further discuss the context, taxonomy and implications of application micro-usage in our field. We conclude with a brief reflection on the relevance of short-term interaction observations for other domains beyond mobile phones.},

Each study exploits its own tools and mechanisms to capture, store, query and analyze Twitter data. Inevitably, platforms have been developed to replace this ad-hoc exploration with a more structured and methodological form of analysis. Another body of literature focuses on developing languages for querying Tweets. This paper addresses issues around the big data nature of Twitter and emphasizes the need for new data management and query language frameworks that address limitations of existing systems. We review existing approaches that were developed to facilitate twitter analytics followed by a discussion on research issues and technical challenges in developing integrated solutions.},

abstract = {The hype on the role of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) continues. At the same time, the failure of ICT for Development (ICT4D) projects is still on the rise. As with other drivers of development initiatives, the effectiveness of ICT as a tool for development will partly be determined by the national policies. Bad policies are likely to have a negative impact which may range from underdevelopment to wasteful spending. It is therefore in the interest of many stakeholders that the ICT policies should capture and shape the role of ICT in development in the correct way. As such, the main aim of this paper is to interrogate and probably uncover the interests of a policy in relation to development. This is particularly relevant for developing countries where ICT policies are known to fail and to lack relevance. To do this, this study uses Habermas's Theory of Communicative Action to analyse Swaziland's National ICT Policy in an attempt to understand its appreciation of development. Findings show that the policy conceptualises development as a form of modernism and economic advancement. The study also shows that the ICT policy has a distorted view of the role of ICT in development. It is hoped that the findings of the study will serve to inform policy-makers of potential blind-spots in their policy formulation.},

abstract = {AsterixDB is a new, full-function BDMS (Big Data Management System) with a feature set that distinguishes it from other platforms in today's open source Big Data ecosystem. Its features make it well-suited to applications like web data warehousing, social data storage and analysis, and other use cases related to Big Data. AsterixDB has a flexible NoSQL style data model; a query language that supports a wide range of queries; a scalable runtime; partitioned, LSM-based data storage and indexing (including B+-tree, R-tree, and text indexes); support for external as well as natively stored data; a rich set of built-in types; support for fuzzy, spatial, and temporal types and queries; a built-in notion of data feeds for ingestion of data; and transaction support akin to that of a NoSQL store.Development of AsterixDB began in 2009 and led to a mid-2013 initial open source release. This paper is the first complete description of the resulting open source AsterixDB system. Covered herein are the system's data model, its query language, and its software architecture. Also included are a summary of the current status of the project and a first glimpse into how AsterixDB performs when compared to alternative technologies, including a parallel relational DBMS, a popular NoSQL store, and a popular Hadoop-based SQL data analytics platform, for things that both technologies can do. Also included is a brief description of some initial trials that the system has undergone and the lessons learned (and plans laid) based on those early "customer" engagements.},

abstract = {R is a popular data analysis language, but there is scant experimental data characterizing the run-time profile of R programs. This paper addresses this limitation by systematically cataloging where time is spent when running R programs. Our evaluation using four different workloads shows that when analyzing large datasets, R programs a) spend more than 85% of their time in processor stalls, which leads to slower execution times, b) trigger the garbage collector frequently, which leads to higher memory stalls, and c) create a large number of unnecessary temporary objects that causes R to swap to disk quickly even for datasets that are far smaller than the available main memory. Addressing these issues should allow R programs to run faster than they do today, and allow R to be used for analyzing even larger datasets. As outlined in this paper, the results presented in this paper motivate a number of future research investigations in the database, architecture, and programming language communities. All data and code that is used in this paper (which includes the R programs, and changes to the R source code for instrumentation) can be found at: http://quickstep.cs.wisc.edu/dissecting-R/.},

We answer this question affirmatively for several diffusion processes-- Push-Pull, Broadcast and SIR-- by showing that it is possible to predict with good accuracy their average evolution. We do this by developing a space efficient predictor that makes it possible to handle very large networks with very limited computational resources. Our experiments show that the prediction is surprisingly good for many instances of real-world networks. The class of real-world networks for which this happens can be characterized in terms of their neighbourhood function, which turns out to be similar to that of random networks. Finally, we analyse real instances of rumour spreading in Twitter and observe that our model describes qualitatively well their evolution.},

abstract = {Students of online graduate or undergraduate programs are also needed of master or bachelor thesis to get their diplomas. In most of the cases, directors and students must face these processes online. However, despite the overall satisfaction with the online learning process, for these works, some students express negative attitudes, such as mistrust and insecurity. Obviously, these negative attitudes are not conducive to learning and student performance. As a result, supervisors are required to minimize the effects of these negative attitudes. Therefore, the monitoring activity is not limited to academic leadership, but also an activity similar to coaching. In this paper, authors investigate what lays behind bachelor and master thesis supervision in online settings. Specifically, authors sought to determine whether academic direction occur while coaching processes. In order to do so, authors applied an open questionnaire to a sample of supervisors. This questionnaire includes questions on four aspects: students' negative attitudes, strategies applied to reduce inappropriate attitudes and to promote good ones, similarities to coaching processes and finally, consideration on the difficulties of online supervision compared with the traditional one in terms of general difficulties, more negative student's attitudes and more effort during supervision. Results show that the majority of the supervisors interviewed had to apply some managerial complements to their duties. These strategies can be considered true coaching processes, although there is not substantial difference between conventional online supervision and traditional supervision of bachelor and master thesis.},

This problem is explored, with reference to the creation of the Informal Learning Collector in the European Commission TRAILER project. It is proposed that formality in learning can be usefully understood as a measure of the degree of managerial control over the learning process. It is then argued that the use of managerial tools, such as validation and competence catalogues, runs the danger of constraining the scope for informal learning. Analytics techniques offer the possibility of providing insight into practice by examining documents, without the need for formal description or tagging. However, these methods raise problems of surveillance (by companies and the state), confidentiality, and security of data. A prototype system is described which tests the feasibility of the approach.},

This experience report takes a fresh look at industry-sponsored CS capstone projects.

We show through user evaluations by known-item search in collections of textural sounds that a default grid layout ordered by filename unexpectedly outperforms content-based similarity layouts resulting from a recent dimension reduction technique (Student-t Stochastic Neighbor Embedding), even when complemented with content-based glyphs that emphasize local neighborhoods and cue perceptual features. We propose a solution borrowed from image browsing: a proximity grid, whose density we optimize for nearest neighborhood preservation among the closest cells. Not only does it remove overlap but we show through a subsequent user evaluation that it also helps to direct the search. We based our experiments on an open dataset (the OLPC sound library) for replicability.},

abstract = {INTO project (Intercultural Mentoring tools to support migrant integration at school), a Comenius Multilateral Project, leaded by Oxfam Italia (Ref. 540440-LLP-1-2013-1-IT-COMENIUS-CMP), aims to introduce in the partner countries' Secondary School context (Italy, Cyprus, Poland, United Kingdom and Spain) peer tutoring actions which could help migrant students in risk of early leaving school or school failure in order to improve not only their marks but their future opportunities as well.The main project outcomes will be the design of a model of intercultural mentoring and the implementation of a peer mentoring programme, which will train school teachers and students (older students either from the last years of their same school or even enrolled in University, or students from their same classroom, preferably with a similar migrant background) to support other newly arrived peers in learning and acquiring the competences necessary for their personal development.},

abstract = {Recommender Systems (RS) play a vital role in applications such as e-commerce and on-demand content streaming. Research on RS has mainly focused on the customer perspective, i.e., accurate prediction of user preferences and maximization of user utilities. As a result, most existing techniques are not explicitly built for revenue maximization, the primary business goal of enterprises. In this work, we explore and exploit a novel connection between RS and the profitability of a business. As recommendations can be seen as an information channel between a business and its customers, it is interesting and important to investigate how to make strategic dynamic recommendations leading to maximum possible revenue. To this end, we propose a novel revenue model that takes into account a variety of factors including prices, valuations, saturation effects, and competition amongst products. Under this model, we study the problem of finding revenue-maximizing recommendation strategies over a finite time horizon. We show that this problem is NP-hard, but approximation guarantees can be obtained for a slightly relaxed version, by establishing an elegant connection to matroid theory. Given the prohibitively high complexity of the approximation algorithm, we also design intelligent heuristics for the original problem. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on two real and synthetic datasets and demonstrate the efficiency, scalability, and effectiveness our algorithms, and that they significantly outperform several intuitive baselines.},

abstract = {Most would agree that modern app-markets have been flooded with applications that not only threaten the security of the OS superficially, but also in their majority, trample on user's privacy through the exposure of sensitive information not necessarily needed for their operation. In this context, the current work revolves around 3 key questions: Is there a way for the end-user to easily track - the many times - hidden privacy leaks occurring due to the way mobile apps operate? Can crowdsourcing provide the end-user with a quantitative assessment per app in terms of privacy exposure level? And if yes, in which way a cloud-based crowdsourcing mechanism can detect and alert for changes in the apps' behavior? Motivated by the aforementioned questions, we design a cloud-based system that operates under a crowdsourcing logic, with the aim to provide i) a real-time privacy-flow tracking service, ii) a collaborative infrastructure for exchanging information related to apps' privacy exposure level, and iii) potentially a behavior-driven detection mechanism in an effort to take advantage of the crowdsourcing data to its maximum efficasy.},

abstract = {In this paper we present WristFlex, an always-available on-body gestural interface. Using an array of force sensitive resistors (FSRs) worn around the wrist, the interface can distinguish subtle finger pinch gestures with high accuracy (&gt;80 %) and speed. The system is trained to classify gestures from subtle tendon movements on the wrist. We demonstrate that WristFlex is a complete system that works wirelessly in real-time. The system is simple and light-weight in terms of power consumption and computational overhead. WristFlex's sensor power consumption is 60.7 uW, allowing the prototype to potentially last more then a week on a small lithium polymer battery. Also, WristFlex is small and non-obtrusive, and can be integrated into a wristwatch or a bracelet. We perform user studies to evaluate the accuracy, speed, and repeatability. We demonstrate that the number of gestures can be extended with orientation data from an accelerometer. We conclude by showing example applications.},

abstract = {We present a novel machine learning based algorithm extending the interaction space around mobile devices. The technique uses only the RGB camera now commonplace on off-the-shelf mobile devices. Our algorithm robustly recognizes a wide range of in-air gestures, supporting user variation, and varying lighting conditions. We demonstrate that our algorithm runs in real-time on unmodified mobile devices, including resource-constrained smartphones and smartwatches. Our goal is not to replace the touchscreen as primary input device, but rather to augment and enrich the existing interaction vocabulary using gestures. While touch input works well for many scenarios, we demonstrate numerous interaction tasks such as mode switches, application and task management, menu selection and certain types of navigation, where such input can be either complemented or better served by in-air gestures. This removes screen real-estate issues on small touchscreens, and allows input to be expanded to the 3D space around the device. We present results for recognition accuracy (93% test and 98% train), impact of memory footprint and other model parameters. Finally, we report results from preliminary user evaluations, discuss advantages and limitations and conclude with directions for future work.},

FlexSense provides a fully self-contained setup which improves mobility and is not affected from occlusions. Using only a sparse set of sensors, printed on the periphery of the surface substrate, we devise two new algorithms to fully reconstruct the complex deformations of the sheet, using only these sparse sensor measurements. An evaluation shows that both proposed algorithms are capable of reconstructing complex deformations accurately. We demonstrate how FlexSense can be used for a variety of 2.5D interactions, including as a transparent cover for tablets where bending can be performed alongside touch to enable magic lens style effects, layered input, and mode switching, as well as the ability to use our device as a high degree-of-freedom input controller for gaming and beyond.},

abstract = {Recommender systems research is often based on comparisons of predictive accuracy: the better the evaluation scores, the better the recommender. However, it is difficult to compare results from different recommender systems due to the many options in design and implementation of an evaluation strategy. Additionally, algorithmic implementations can diverge from the standard formulation due to manual tuning and modifications that work better in some situations.In this work we compare common recommendation algorithms as implemented in three popular recommendation frameworks. To provide a fair comparison, we have complete control of the evaluation dimensions being benchmarked: dataset, data splitting, evaluation strategies, and metrics. We also include results using the internal evaluation mechanisms of these frameworks. Our analysis points to large differences in recommendation accuracy across frameworks and strategies, i.e. the same baselines may perform orders of magnitude better or worse across frameworks. Our results show the necessity of clear guidelines when reporting evaluation of recommender systems to ensure reproducibility and comparison of results.},

The evaluation and optimization of such queries is an intriguing new problem for database research. In this article, we discuss two important aspects of this problem: query rewriting and query optimization. Query rewriting consists of the compilation of an ontological query into an equivalent first-order query against the underlying extensional database. We present a novel query rewriting algorithm for rather general types of ontological constraints that is well suited for practical implementations. In particular, we show how a conjunctive query against a knowledge base, expressed using linear and sticky existential rules, that is, members of the recently introduced Datalog± family of ontology languages, can be compiled into a union of conjunctive queries (UCQ) against the underlying database. Ontological query optimization, in this context, attempts to improve this rewriting process soas to produce possibly small and cost-effective UCQ rewritings for an input query.},

abstract = {India has a large and growing population using internet services for various needs. In the early stage of development IRCTC has created a huge mass of Indian population dependent on internet for online booking of railway ticket. In recent times, there has been manifold increase in exposure and usage of internet to connect Customers to online buying portal for buying various other things. Although the online market in India is at early stage it is expected to grow fast. Due to technology advancement, access to internet, increase in exposure and income, shopping via internet has been showing signs of growth. These technological advancement lead to better lives and have provided a platform to shop grocery items online. Looking at this niche segment and potential of upcoming vibrant market, it would be interesting to understand Customer perception on such services. This trend requires different insight to understand and analyze how online shopping is considerably different from store-based shopping. Marketers have huge opportunity to explore this field as Customers are buying &amp; spending more time online as compare to old times. Today, online shoppers have high expectation as they have from any other store -- based retailers. To grab this opportunity retailers are using various strategies to attract Customers to shop online. This paper seeks to understand the patterns of online grocery shopping in India; and explores the factors &amp; trends influencing the online grocery shopping. Our research study focuses to identify various patterns of buying grocery online and factors affecting the process of buying. Worldwide there are studies conducted on online grocery shopping, however we found that very limited studies are highlighting on Indian online grocery market. Therefore our study would help exploring this new dimension of online grocery shopping},

However, reliability issues brought about by scaling in the sub-20nm era threaten to undermine the benefits offered by NoCs. In this paper, we showthat QoS policies exacerbate the reliability profile of an exascale system. To mitigate this imposing challenge, we propose Dynamic Wearout Resilient Routing (DWRR) algorithms in QoS-enabled exascale NoCs. Our proposal includes two novel DWRR algorithms enabled by a critical-pathmonitor and a broadcast-based routing configuration. Using PARSEC benchmarks, our best algorithm improves QoS and long-term sustainability (Mean Time To Failure) of the system by an average of 16% and 25% compared to a state-of-the-art fault tolerant technique, respectively.},

The use of ultra-low-power MCUs in such applications provides a clear advantage in terms of energy consumption. However, given their general-purpose nature and low-power needs, security has not been the main focus in the past. This work places emphasis on methodologically analyzing open security gaps at a system level and providing a score for each vulnerability found. Such vulnerability scores help prioritize the efforts towards building a secure system and balancing the trade-off between suitable protection and minimal cost. The work presented uses as an example an abstraction of metering applications implemented using a general purpose microcontroller. The presented approach makes use of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System open framework to quantify the impact of possible vulnerabilities and prioritize their remediation based on their relevancy.},

abstract = {We propose an extension of the divide-and-conquer (DC) algorithmic paradigm called divide-conquer-recombine (DCR) in order to develop O(N) applications that will continue to scale on future parallel supercomputing, i.e., making them metascalable (or "design once, scale on new architectures"). In DCR, the DC phase constructs globally informed local solutions, which in the recombine phase are synthesized into a global solution. Innovative recombination algorithms allow the synthesis of a variety of global properties in broad applications. To enable large spatial-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, DCR-in-space is empowered by globally scalable and locally fast (GSLF) hybrid solvers based on spatial locality. In addition, DCR-in-time is used to predict long-time dynamics based on temporal locality, while utilizing space-time-ensemble parallelism (STEP). We have used DCR to perform quantum molecular dynamics (QMD) and reactive molecular dynamics (RMD) simulations that encompass unprecedented spatiotemporal scales. Our 50.3 million-atom QMD benchmark achieved a parallel efficiency of 0.984 and 50.5% of the peak floating-point performance on 786,432 IBM Blue Gene/Q cores. Production QMD simulation involving 16,661 atoms for 21,140 time steps (or 129,208 self-consistent-field iterations) revealed a novel nanostructural design for on-demand hydrogen production from water, advancing renewable energy technologies. Nonadiabatic QMD simulation of photoexcitation dynamics involving 6,400 atoms reached the experimental time scales, elucidating molecular mechanisms of a novel singlet-fission phenomenon to realize low-cost, high-efficiency solar cells. Our billion-atom RMD simulation revealed the role of focused nanojet for the damage of solid surface caused by shock-induced collapse of nanobubbles in water, and suggested how to mitigate the damage by filling the bubble with inert gas.},

abstract = {Conversational systems and robots that use reinforcement learning for policy optimization in large domains often face the problem of limited scalability. This problem has been addressed either by using function approximation techniques that estimate the approximate true value function of a policy or by using a hierarchical decomposition of a learning task into subtasks. We present a novel approach for dialogue policy optimization that combines the benefits of both hierarchical control and function approximation and that allows flexible transitions between dialogue subtasks to give human users more control over the dialogue. To this end, each reinforcement learning agent in the hierarchy is extended with a subtask transition function and a dynamic state space to allow flexible switching between subdialogues. In addition, the subtask policies are represented with linear function approximation in order to generalize the decision making to situations unseen in training. Our proposed approach is evaluated in an interactive conversational robot that learns to play quiz games. Experimental results, using simulation and real users, provide evidence that our proposed approach can lead to more flexible (natural) interactions than strict hierarchical control and that it is preferred by human users.},
