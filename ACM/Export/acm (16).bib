abstract = {A wide range of malicious activities rely on the domain name service (DNS) to manage their large, distributed networks of infected machines. As a consequence, the monitoring and analysis of DNS queries has recently been proposed as one of the most promising techniques to detect and blacklist domains involved in malicious activities (e.g., phishing, spam, botnets command-and-control, etc.). EXPOSURE is a system we designed to detect such domains in real time, by applying 15 unique features grouped in four categories.We conducted a controlled experiment with a large, real-world dataset consisting of billions of DNS requests. The extremely positive results obtained in the tests convinced us to implement our techniques and deploy it as a free, online service. In this article, we present the Exposure system and describe the results and lessons learned from 17 months of its operation. Over this amount of time, the service detected over 100K malicious domains. The statistics about the time of usage, number of queries, and target IP addresses of each domain are also published on a daily basis on the service Web page.},

abstract = {Monitoring dynamic objects in surveillance applications is normally a demanding activity for operators, not only because of the complexity and high dimensionality of the data but also because of other factors like time constraints and uncertainty. Timely detection of anomalous objects or situations that need further investigation may reduce operatorsâ€™ cognitive load. Surveillance applications may include anomaly detection capabilities, but their use is not widespread, as they usually generate a high number of false alarms, they do not provide appropriate cognitive support for operators, and their outcomes can be difficult to comprehend and trust. Visual analytics can bridge the gap between computational and human approaches to detecting anomalous behavior in traffic data, making this process more transparent. As a step toward this goal of transparency, this article presents an evaluation that assesses whether visualizations of normal behavioral models of vessel traffic support two of the main analytical tasks specified during our field work in maritime control centers. The evaluation combines quantitative and qualitative usability assessments. The quantitative evaluation, which was carried out with a proof-of-concept prototype, reveals that participants who used the visualization of normal behavioral models outperformed the group that did not do so. The qualitative assessment shows that domain experts have a positive attitude toward the provision of automatic support and the visualization of normal behavioral models, as these aids may reduce reaction time and increase trust in and comprehensibility of the system.},

abstract = {Small groups can have a better museum visit when that visit is both a social and an educational occasion. The unmediated discussion that often ensues during a shared cultural experience, especially when it is with a small group whose members already know each other, has been shown by ethnographers to be important for a more enriching experience. We present DRAMATRIC, a mobile presentation system that delivers hour-long dramas to small groups of museum visitors. DRAMATRIC continuously receives sensor data from the museum environment during a museum visit and analyzes group behavior from that data. On the basis of that analysis, DRAMATRIC delivers a series of dynamically coordinated dramatic scenes about exhibits that the group walks near, each designed to stimulate group discussion. Each drama presentation contains small, complementary differences in the narrative content heard by the different members of the group, leveraging the tension/release cycle of narrative to naturally lead visitors to fill in missing pieces in their own drama by interacting with their fellow group members. Using four specific techniques to produce these coordinated narrative variations, we describe two experiments: one in a neutral, nonmobile environment, and the other a controlled experiment with a full-scale drama in an actual museum. The first experiment tests the hypothesis that narrative differences will lead to increased conversation compared to hearing identical narratives, whereas the second experiment tests whether switching from presenting a drama using one technique to using another technique for the subsequent drama will result in increased conversation. The first experiment shows that hearing coordinated narrative variations can in fact lead to significantly increased conversation. The second experiment also serves as a framework for future studies that evaluate strategies for similar adaptive systems.},

abstract = {Scatterplots are commonly used to visualize multidimensional data; however, 2D projections of data offer limited understanding of the high-dimensional interactions between data points. We introduce an interactive 3D extension of scatterplots called the Regression Cube (RC), which augments a 3D scatterplot with three facets on which the correlations between the two variables are revealed by sensitivity lines and sensitivity streamlines. The sensitivity visualization of local regression on the 2D projections provides insights about the shape of the data through its orientation and continuity cues. We also introduce a series of visual operations such as clustering, brushing, and selection supported in RC. By iteratively refining the selection of data points of interest, RC is able to reveal salient local correlation patterns that may otherwise remain hidden with a global analysis. We have demonstrated our system with two examples and a user-oriented evaluation, and we show how RCs enable interactive visual exploration of multidimensional datasets via a variety of classification and information retrieval tasks. A video demo of RC is available.},

abstract = {With more than 22 million articles, the largest collaborative knowledge resource never sleeps, experiencing several article edits every second. Over one fifth of these articles describes individual people, the majority of which are still alive. Such articles are, by their nature, prone to corruption and vandalism. Manual quality assurance by experts can barely cope with this massive amount of data. Can it be effectively replaced by feedback from the crowd? Can we provide meaningful support for quality assurance with automated text processing techniques? Which properties of the articles should then play a key role in the machine learning algorithms and why? In this paper, we study the user-perceived quality of Wikipedia articles based on a novel Wikipedia user feedback dataset. In contrast to previous work on quality assessment which mostly relied on judgements of active Wikipedia authors, we analyze ratings of ordinary Wikipedia users along four quality dimensions (Complete, Well written, Trustworthy and Objective). We first present an empirical analysis of the novel dataset with over 36 million Wikipedia article ratings. We then select a subset of biographical articles and perform classification experiments to predict their quality ratings along each of the dimensions, exploring multiple linguistic, surface and network properties of the rated articles. Additionally, we study the classification performance and differences for the biographies of living and dead people as well as those for men and women. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by the F-scores of 0.94, 0.89, 0.73, and 0.73 for the dimensions Complete, Well written, Trustworthy, and Objective. Based on the results, we believe that the quality assessment of big textual data can be effectively supported by current text classification and language processing tools.},

abstract = {Writing is a vital issue for education as well as a fundamental skill in teaching and learning. With the development of information technologies, more and more professional writing tools emerge. As each of them mostly concentrates on addressing a specific issue, people need a one-stop platform, which could integrate multiply functions. In addition, with the supported concept of e-learning ecosystem for future education, a comprehensive platform will be more promising. Therefore, we introduce VeriGuide Platform, which provides a professional writing toolbox to promote the enhancement of teaching and learning in writing. It contains six vertical components, which could be split into two groups. The first group, Editing Assistance, facilitates students write papers and point out grammar and spelling errors. While the second group, Text Analysis, offers document analysis results, which enables students to achieve further writing improvement with explanatory feedbacks. Furthermore, we could do education data analytics to enhance the efficiency of teaching and learning. Specifically, the Editing Assistance contains well-organized writing and formatting, and grammar and spelling checking, while readability assessment, similarity detection, citation analysis, and sentiment analysis are included in the Text Analysis.},

abstract = {On many social networking web sites such as Facebook and Twitter, resharing or reposting functionality allows users to share others' content with their own friends or followers. As content is reshared from user to user, large cascades of reshares can form. While a growing body of research has focused on analyzing and characterizing such cascades, a recent, parallel line of work has argued that the future trajectory of a cascade may be inherently unpredictable. In this work, we develop a framework for addressing cascade prediction problems. On a large sample of photo reshare cascades on Facebook, we find strong performance in predicting whether a cascade will continue to grow in the future. We find that the relative growth of a cascade becomes more predictable as we observe more of its reshares, that temporal and structural features are key predictors of cascade size, and that initially, breadth, rather than depth in a cascade is a better indicator of larger cascades. This prediction performance is robust in the sense that multiple distinct classes of features all achieve similar performance. We also discover that temporal features are predictive of a cascade's eventual shape. Observing independent cascades of the same content, we find that while these cascades differ greatly in size, we are still able to predict which ends up the largest.},

We introduce the concept of word storms, a visualization tool for analyzing corpora of documents. A word storm is a group of word clouds, in which each cloud represents a single document, juxtaposed to allow the viewer to compare and contrast the documents. We present a novel algorithm that creates a coordinated word storm, in which words that appear in multiple documents are placed in the same location, using the same color and orientation, across clouds. This ensures that similar documents are represented by similar-looking word clouds, making them easier to compare and contrast visually. We evaluate the algorithm using an automatic evaluation based on document classification, and a user study. The results confirm that a coordinated word storm allows for better visual comparison of documents.},

abstract = {While automated methods are the first line of defense for detecting attacks on webservers, a human agent is required to understand the attacker's intent and the attack process. The goal of this research is to understand the value of various log fields and the cognitive processes by which log information is grouped, searched, and correlated. Such knowledge will enable the development of human-focused log file investigation technologies. We performed controlled experiments with 65 subjects (IT professionals and novices) who investigated excerpts from six webserver log files. Quantitative and qualitative data were gathered to: 1) analyze subject accuracy in identifying malicious activity; 2) identify the most useful pieces of log file information; and 3) understand the techniques and strategies used by subjects to process the information. Statistically significant effects were observed in the accuracy of identifying attacks and time taken depending on the type of attack. Systematic differences were also observed in the log fields used by high-performing and low-performing groups. The findings include: 1) new insights into how specific log data fields are used to effectively assess potentially malicious activity; 2) obfuscating factors in log data from a human cognitive perspective; and 3) practical implications for tools to support log file investigations.},

This paper concentrates on IDS carefully designed to cater to the security needs of modern mobile platforms. Two main research issues are tackled: (a) the definition of an architecture which can be used towards implementing and deploying such a system in a dual-mode (host/cloud) manner and irrespectively of the underlying platform, and (b) the evaluation of a proof-of-concept anomaly-based IDS implementation that incorporates dissimilar detection features, with the aim to assess its performance qualities when running on state-of-the-art mobile hardware on the host device and on the cloud. This approach allows us to argue in favor of a hybrid host/cloud IDS arrangement (as it assembles the best characteristics of both worlds) and to provide quantitative evaluation facts on if and in which cases machine learning-driven detection is affordable when executed on-device.},

As part of the project, a simulation model is developed for evaluating alternative strategies for pricing the entrance ticket at the museum. TPM is visited by more than three million visitors annually and generate revenue. Due to its popularity and physical constraints at the site, it is common to observe long queues before the exhibition halls inside the museum. The simulation model is developed which considers physical layout of the museum including open space walking area and exhibition halls. By using the model, effects of creating a new ticket type, "exclusive ticket", are evaluated. The new ticket type costs more but has the advantage of gaining priority in waiting line queues. Based on the simulation results, we estimate that the new ticket type will increase the revenue and provide fast-track visiting option for tourists.},

abstract = {IaaS providers often allow the users to specify many requirements for their applications. However, users without advanced technical knowledge usually do not provide a good specification of the cloud environment, leading to low performance and/or high monetary cost. In this context, the users face the challenges of how to scale cloud-unaware applications without re-engineering them. Therefore, in this paper, we propose and evaluate a cloud architecture, namely Excalibur, to execute applications in the cloud. In our architecture, the users provide the applications and the architecture sets up the whole environment and adjusts it at run-time accordingly. We executed a genomics workflow in our architecture, which was deployed in Amazon EC2. The experiments show that the proposed architecture dynamically scales this cloud-unaware application up to 10 instances, reducing the execution time by 73% and the cost by 84% when compared to the execution in the configuration specified by the user.},

Practical speech analysis solutions are needed to help monitor ongoing conditions such as depression, as the amount of social interaction and vocal affect is important for assessing mood and well-being. Although there are existing solutions that classify the identity and the mood of a speaker, when the acoustic signals are captured in reverberant environments they perform poorly. In this paper, we present a practical reverberation compensation method called RESONATE, which uses simulated room impulse responses to adapt a training corpus for use in multiple real reverberant rooms. We demonstrate that the system creates robust classifiers that perform within 5 -- 10% of baseline accuracy of non-reverberant environments. We demonstrate and evaluate the performance of this matched condition strategy using a public dataset, and also in controlled experiments with six rooms, and two long-term and uncontrolled real deployments. We offer a practical implementation that performs collection, feature extraction, and classification on-node, and training and simulation of training sets on a base station or cloud service.},

In this work, we study an optimal sensor placement scheme to measure the wind distribution over a large urban reservoir with a limited number of wind sensors. Unlike existing sensor placement solutions that assume Gaussian process of target phenomena, this study measures the wind which inherently exhibits strong non-Gaussian yearly distribution. By leveraging the local monsoon characteristics of wind, we segment a year into different monsoon seasons which follow a unique distribution respectively. We also use computational fluid dynamics to learn the spatial correlation of wind in the presence of surrounding buildings. The output of sensor placement is a set of the most informative locations to deploy the wind sensors, based on the readings of which we can accurately predict the wind over the entire reservoir surface in real time. 10 wind sensors are finally deployed around or on the water surface of an urban reservoir. The in-field measurement results of more than 3 months suggest that the proposed sensor placement and spatial prediction approach provides accurate wind measurement which outperforms the state-of-the-art Gaussian model based or interpolation based approaches.},

The major challenge, however, is to develop computational models for automated detection of health events that can work reliably in the natural field environment. In this paper, we develop a physiologically-informed model to automatically detect drug (cocaine) use events in the free-living environment of participants from their electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements. The key to reliably detecting drug use events in the field is to incorporate the knowledge of autonomic nervous system (ANS) behavior in the model development so as to decompose the activation effect of cocaine from the natural recovery behavior of the parasympathetic nervous system (after an episode of physical activity). We collect 89 days of data from 9 active drug users in two residential lab environments and 922 days of data from 42 active drug users in the field environment, for a total of 11,283 hours. We develop a model that tracks the natural recovery by the parasympathetic nervous system and then estimates the dampening caused to the recovery by the activation of the sympathetic nervous system due to cocaine. We develop efficient methods to screen and clean the ECG time series data and extract candidate windows to assess for potential drug use. We then apply our model on the recovery segments from these windows. Our model achieves 100% true positive rate while keeping the false positive rate to 0.87/day over (9+ hours/day of) lab data and to 1.13/day over (11+ hours/day of) field data.},

abstract = {Over the last decade consumers have witnessed a dramatic increase in the use of low fidelity, discrete vibrotactile feedback to enhance or replace audio stimuli in entertainment systems. However, use of high-resolution continuous vibrotactile displays remains quite uncommon. The Emoti-Chair is a high-resolution continuous vibrotactile display that may be driven by any type of audio signal, and is purported to convey the emotional properties of sound through organized vibrotactile stimulation. In the current study, we examined the ability of the Emoti-Chair to convey the emotional content of the soundtrack in a horror film. Increases in skin conductance levels were observed when vibrotactile stimuli were added to audio/visual film content. These results provide evidence that users can augment the communication of emotion in film through use of a high-resolution continuous vibrotactile display.},

abstract = {Traditional audio editing tools do not facilitate the task of separating a single mixture recording (e.g. pop song) into its respective sources (e.g. drums, vocal, etc.). Such ability, however, would be very useful for a wide variety of audio applications such as music remixing, audio denoising, and audio-based forensics. To address this issue, we present ISSE - an interactive source separation editor. ISSE is a new open-source, freely available, and cross-platform audio editing tool that enables a user to perform source separation by painting on time-frequency visualizations of sound, resulting in an interactive machine learning system. The system brings to life our previously proposed interaction paradigm and separation algorithm that learns from user-feedback to perform separation. For evaluation, we conducted user studies and compared results between inexperienced and expert users. For a variety of real-world tasks, we found that inexperienced users can achieve good separation quality with minimal instruction and expert users can achieve state-of-the-art separation quality.},

The paper reports an interview study with activity tracker users.

We suggest there will be difficulties in personal informatics if we ignore the way that personal tracking is enmeshed with everyday life and people's outlook on their future.},

A more accurate source of data could be gained from wearable computing designed for physical therapy exercise support. Existing systems have been tested in the lab but we have little information about issues they may face in home settings. We designed a technology probe, SenseCap, and deployed it for seven days in ten physical therapy patients' homes. SenseCap is a wearable physical therapy support system that gathers patient exercise compliance and performance data and summarizes the data in charts on an iPad Dashboard for physical therapists to view when patients return to the clinic. In this paper, we present the results of our deployment, show in-home patient exercise data gathered by the probe, and make design recommendations based on patient and physical therapist responses.},

abstract = {Understanding the driver's cognitive load is important for evaluating in-vehicle user interfaces. This paper describes experiments to assess machine learning classification algorithms on their ability to automatically identify elevated cognitive workload levels in drivers, leading towards the development of robust tools for automobile user interface evaluation. We look at using both driver performance as well as physiological data. These measures can be collected in real-time and do not interfere with the primary task of driving the vehicle. We report classification accuracies of up to 90% for detecting elevated levels of cognitive load, and show that the inclusion of physiological data leads to higher classification accuracy than vehicle sensor data evaluated alone. Finally, we show results suggesting that models can be built to classify cognitive load across individuals, instead of building individual models for each per-son. By collecting data from drivers in two large field studies on the highway (20 drivers and 99 drivers), this work extends prior work and demonstrates feasibility and potential of such measures for HCI research in vehicles.},

We introduce RecoFit, a system for automatically tracking repetitive exercises - such as weight training and calisthenics - via an arm-worn inertial sensor. Our goal is to provide real-time and post-workout feedback, with no user-specific training and no intervention during a workout. Toward this end, we address three challenges: (1) segmenting exercise from intermittent non-exercise periods, (2) recognizing which exercise is being performed, and (3) counting repetitions. We present cross-validation results on our training data and results from a study assessing the final system, totaling 114 participants over 146 sessions. We achieve precision and recall greater than 95% in identifying exercise periods, recognition of 99%, 98%, and 96% on circuits of 4, 7, and 13 exercises respectively, and counting that is accurate to Â±1 repetition 93% of the time. These results suggest that our approach enables a new category of fitness tracking devices.},

This adds value to UbiComp and personal informatics in terms of user context and new performance data to collect and visualize, and it benefits healthcare as sleep is correlated with many health issues. To assess this opportunity, we collected one month of phone sensor and sleep diary entries from 27 people who have a variety of sleep contexts. We used this data to construct models that detect sleep and wake states, daily sleep quality, and global sleep quality. Our system classifies sleep state with 93.06% accuracy, daily sleep quality with 83.97% accuracy, and overall sleep quality with 81.48% accuracy. Individual models performed better than generally trained models, where the individual models require 3 days of ground truth data and 3 weeks of ground truth data to perform well on detecting sleep and sleep quality, respectively. Finally, the features of noise and movement were useful to infer sleep quality.},

In this work, we aim to gain insights from these "extreme users," who have used existing technologies and built their own workarounds to overcome different barriers. We conducted a qualitative and quantitative analysis of 52 video recordings of Quantified Self Meetup talks to understand what they did, how they did it, and what they learned. We highlight several common pitfalls to self-tracking, including tracking too many things, not tracking triggers and context, and insufficient scientific rigor. We identify future research efforts that could help make progress toward addressing these pitfalls.

We conducted a preliminary study to explore whether and if so, how, individuals in an economically distressed population with limited social capital use technologies to increase social capital and achieve socio-economic security. We contribute details about barriers affecting social capital (e.g., difficulties finding and making the right connections and an overall lack of trust within communities).

Our research covers a full design process including a qualitative-empirical pre-study, the prototyping process and the investigation of long-term appropriation processes of the stable prototypes in three different practice environments. Specifically, we deal with the problem of 'wandering' by persons suffering from late-phase dementia. Although GPS tracking is not a novel technological objective, the usage of those systems in dementia care remains very low. The paper therefore takes a socio-technical stance on development and appropriation of GPS technology in dementia care and assesses the practical and ideological issues surrounding care to understand why. We additionally provide design research in two different settings, familial and institutional care, and report on the design of a GPS-based tracking system reflecting these considerations. What comes to the fore is the need for ICT to reflect complex organizational, ideological and practical issues that form part of a moral universe where sensitivity is crucial.},

abstract = {Mobile instant messaging (e.g., via SMS or WhatsApp) often goes along with an expectation of high attentiveness, i.e., that the receiver will notice and read the message within a few minutes. Hence, existing instant messaging services for mobile phones share indicators of availability, such as the last time the user has been online. However, in this paper we not only provide evidence that these cues create social pressure, but that they are also weak predictors of attentiveness. As remedy, we propose to share a machine-computed prediction of whether the user will view a message within the next few minutes or not. For two weeks, we collected behavioral data from 24 users of mobile instant messaging services. By the means of machine-learning techniques, we identified that simple features extracted from the phone, such as the user's interaction with the notification center, the screen activity, the proximity sensor, and the ringer mode, are strong predictors of how quickly the user will attend to the messages. With seven automatically selected features our model predicts whether a phone user will view a message within a few minutes with 70.6% accuracy and a precision for fast attendance of 81.2%},

A number of studies have investigated driving style, but they often rely on the use of self-reports or simulators, which are not suitable for the real-time, continuous, automated assessment and feedback on the road. In order to understand and model aggressive driving style, we construct an in-vehicle sensing platform that uses a smartphone instead of using heavyweight, expensive systems. Utilizing additional cheap sensors, our sensing platform can collect useful information about vehicle movement, maneuvering and steering wheel movement. We use this data and apply machine learning to build a driver model that evaluates drivers' driving styles based on a number of driving-related features. From a naturalistic data collection from 22 drivers for 3 weeks, we analyzed the characteristics of drivers who have an aggressive driving style. Our model classified those drivers with an accuracy of 90.5% (violation-class) and 81% (questionnaire-class). We describe how, in future work, our model can be used to provide real-time feedback to drivers using only their current smartphone.},

We propose the use of motion signatures a technique that utilizes pairs of motion history images and a random forest based classifier to robustly recognize a large set of motion gestures on and directly above the keyboard. Our technique achieves a mean per-frame classification accuracy of 75.6% in leave-one-subject-out and 89.9% in half-test/half-training cross-validation. We detail our hardware and gesture recognition algorithm, provide performance and accuracy numbers, and demonstrate a large set of gestures designed to be performed with our device.

We first divide the participants into risk and non-risk groups based on self-reported rating scale for smartphone overuse. We then analyze the usage data to identify between-group usage differences, which ranged from the overall usage patterns to app-specific usage patterns. Compared with the non-risk group, our results show that the risk group has longer usage time per day and different diurnal usage patterns. Also, the risk group users are more susceptible to push notifications, and tend to consume more online content. We characterize the overall relationship between usage features and smartphone overuse using analytic modeling and provide detailed illustrations of problematic usage behaviors based on interview data.},

Their satisfaction might be an indicator that they perceive group interactions as beneficial and a precursor to group commitment. We examined whether receiving emotional and informational support is satisfying in its own right, or whether satisfaction depends on matches between what users sought and what they received. Two studies collected judgments in a breast cancer support community of support users sought, support they received, and their expressed satisfaction. While receiving emotional or informational support in general positively predicted satisfaction, users expressed less satisfaction when they sought informational support but received emotional support.

abstract = {Alternative mobility modes for older adults are increasingly important for economic, ecological and social reasons. A promising option is ridesharing, defined as use of the same vehicle by two or more people traveling to a common destination. In particular, mobile computer supported ridesharing provides a promising way to enlarge older adults' mobility choices in addition to private driving and public transportation options. In order to understand the opportunities and obstacles of ridesharing from the point of view of elderly people, we conducted an interview study in order to examining ridesharing experiences. It turns out that "mobile independence" and "decisional autonomy" are key issues for mobile wellbeing. This partially conflicts with common ridesharing concepts. Hence, we further analyze older adults' strategies dealing with these conflicts and show that these strategies offer departure points for the design ridesharing solutions, which are better suited to the demands of older adults.},

abstract = {Medication taking is a self-regulatory process that requires individuals to self-monitor their medication taking behaviors, but this can be difficult because medication taking is such a mundane, unremarkable behavior. Ubiquitous sensing systems have the potential to sense everyday behaviors and provide the objective feedback necessary for self-regulation of medication taking. We describe an unobtrusive sensing system consisting of a sensor-augmented pillbox and an ambient display that provides near real-time visual feedback about how well medications are being taken. In contrast to other systems that focus on reminding before medication taking, our approach uses feedback after medication taking to allow the individual to develop their own routines through self-regulation. We evaluated this system in the homes of older adults in a 10-month deployment. Feedback helped improve the consistency of medication-taking behaviors as well as increased ratings of self-efficacy. However, the improved performance did not persist after the feedback display was removed, because individuals had integrated the feedback display into their routines to support their self-awareness, identify mistakes, guide the timing of medication taking, and provide a sense of security that they are taking their medications well. Finally, we reflect on design considerations for feedback systems to support the process of self-regulation of everyday behaviors.},

abstract = {Governments and other organisations often rely on data collected by household surveys and censuses to identify areas in most need of regeneration and development projects. However, due to the high cost associated with the data collection process, many developing countries conduct such surveys very infrequently and include only a rather small sample of the population, thus failing to accurately capture the current socio-economic status of the country's population. In this paper, we address this problem by means of a methodology that relies on an alternative source of data from which to derive up to date poverty indicators, at a very fine level of spatio-temporal granularity. Taking two developing countries as examples, we show how to analyse the aggregated call detail records of mobile phone subscribers and extract features that are strongly correlated with poverty indexes currently derived from census data.},

Social technologies offer enormous potential for enhancing aged care, but research on their use in aged care has largely focused on institutional or informal care settings, rather than formal care in the home. Meanwhile, technologies for aging in place typically focus on monitoring and security, rather than psychosocial support. We conducted a field study in which aged care managers used a photo and message-sharing tool to communicate with clients living in their own homes. Our findings demonstrate that visual and social forms of communication are valuable for supporting psychosocial care-giving, but there are barriers to effectively adopting new communication tools in this setting. Time constraints inhibited care managers' use of the technology, which was also influenced by their efforts to carefully maintain boundaries between their personal and professional lives.},

From these physiological signals, we can adapt a simulation in order to optimize workload in real-time, which allows the system to better fit the task to the user from moment to moment. To demonstrate this idea, we ran a laboratory study in which participants performed path planning for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in a simulation. Based on their state, we varied the difficulty of the task by adding or removing UAVs and found that we were able to decrease error by 35% over a baseline condition. Our results show that we can use fNIRS brain sensing to detect task difficulty in real-time and construct an interface that improves user performance through dynamic difficulty adjustment.},

We explore how passengers influence the movement of the bus and how the technology frames bus drivers' relationships to their managers and commuters.

However, the session creation process can be difficult and time-consuming due to the amount of expertise and effort required to consider alternative paper groupings. We present a collaborative web application called Frenzy to draw on the efforts and knowledge of an entire program committee. Frenzy comprises (a) interfaces to support large numbers of experts working collectively to create sessions, and (b) a two-stage process that decomposes the session-creation problem into meta-data elicitation and global constraint satisfaction. Meta-data elicitation involves a large group of experts working simultaneously, while global constraint satisfaction involves a smaller group that uses the meta-data to form sessions.We evaluated Frenzy with 48 people during a deployment at the CSCW 2014 program committee meeting. The session making process was much faster than the traditional process, taking 88 minutes instead of a full day. We found that meta-data elicitation was useful for session creation. Moreover, the sessions created by Frenzy were the basis of the CSCW 2014 schedule.},

We observed that many interesting physiological responses did not feature in participants' think-aloud data, and conversely, reports of interesting experiences were sometimes not observed in the collected physiological data. Through learnings from our experiment, we present some of the challenges when combining these approaches and offer some guidelines as to how qualitative and quantitative data can be used together to gain deeper insights into player experiences.},

This work conducted a user study to investigate the pupil dilations during aiming in a tele-operation setting, with the purpose of better understanding how the changes in task requirements are reflected by the changes of pupil size. The task requirements, managed by Fitts' index of difficulty (ID), i.e. the size and distance apart of the targets, were varied between tasks, and pupil responses to different task IDs were recorded. The results showed that pupil diameter can be employed as an indicator of task requirements in goal-directed movements-higher task difficulty evoked higher valley to peak pupil dilation, and the peak pupil dilation occurred after a longer delay. These findings contribute to the foundation for developing methods to objectively evaluate interactive task requirements using pupil parameters during goal-directed movements in HCI.},

As smartphone adoption increases facilitating ESM studies and making photo sharing easier, researchers need to continuously evaluate the method and investigate the role of photos in such studies. We conducted a large-scale ESM and retrospective survey study via Android smartphones with more than 1,000 US participants, and analyzed participants' photo submissions, including how photo use correlated with participants' data quality and what, if any, value photos added for researchers. Our study sheds light on the role of photos in ESM and retrospective studies that researchers can reference when constructing future study designs.},

The method is presently gaining ground in sports, medicine, and industrial ergonomics, but it also bears great potential for studies in HCI where the physical ergonomics of a design is important. To make the method more broadly accessible, we study its predictive validity for movements and users typical to studies in HCI. We discuss the sources of error in biomechanical simulation and present results from two validation studies conducted with a state-of-the-art system. Study I tested aimed movements ranging from multitouch gestures to dancing, finding out that the critical limiting factor is the size of movement. Study II compared muscle activation predictions to surface-EMG recordings in a 3D pointing task. The data shows medium-to-high validity that is, however, constrained by some characteristics of the movement and the user. We draw concrete recommendations to practitioners and discuss challenges to developing the method further.},

In particular, those with higher performance benefited more than those with lower performance.},

Leaders and members agree that all of these goals are important, but their perceptions of success on goals do not align with each other, or with commonly used behavioral success measures.

Such adoption is paradoxical, however, as past research has repeatedly shown major co-organizational barriers; teams cannot agree a common organizational scheme, making it difficult to retrieve information organized by others. Another barrier is email competition; email provides a reliable alternative for distributing files that are then personally organized. To address this paradox, we explored how 27 participants actively using shared repositories overcome these barriers in a qualitative study. We found teams addressed co-organization using 4 strategies. First they create ContentMaps that provide explicit structure to organize shared information. Participants also co-organize using implicit strategies based on task structure, expertise, and tool affordances. Greater shared repository use also leads to a changed role for email. Versioning problems mean email is not used for distributing attachments, instead for task management. We present technical implications suggesting how new tools might be better integrated with email facilitating these continued email uses.},

abstract = {System design for seniors often focuses on the decline of their biological capabilities and social connectedness. This approach has been challenged as too simplistic to capture what it really means to be senior. This paper presents a qualitative study of 17 seniors in urban China (age ranging from 50s to 70s), who have adopted and incorporated ICT into their daily lives. Findings from this study show that the ways in which seniors attend to ICT are not simply shaped by changes in health or other wellbeing, but also by their life attitudes, value systems, relationships to younger generations as well as historical specifics during their coming of age. This paper contributes by showing that 1) what it means to be senior is shaped from within a whole social ecology of past and current experiences, values and interactions; 2) senior identities are not fixed, but continuously negotiated, articulated and enacted through ICT; 3) social interaction and access of technologies are highly intertwined.},

abstract = {Smartphone apps can use object recognition software to provide information to blind or low vision users about objects in the visual environment. A crucial challenge for these users is aiming the camera properly to take a well-framed picture of the desired target object. We investigate the effects of two fundamental constraints of object recognition -- frame rate and camera field of view -- on a blind person's ability to use an object recognition smartphone app. The app was used by 18 blind participants to find visual targets beyond arm's reach and approach them to within 30 cm. While we expected that a faster frame rate or wider camera field of view should always improve search performance, our experimental results show that in many cases increasing the field of view does not help, and may even hurt, performance. These results have important implications for the design of object recognition systems for blind users.},

To investigate how people accept, use, and perceive food messaging, we conducted exploratory interviews, a field study, and follow-up interviews over four weeks in a large information technology (IT) company. We collected 904 messages sent by 343 users. Our results suggest strong acceptance of food messaging as an alternative message channel. Further analysis implies that food messaging embodies characteristics of both text messaging and gifting. It is preferred in close relationships for its evocation of positive emotions. As the first field study on edible social messaging, our empirical findings provide valuable insights into the uniqueness of food as a message carrier and its capabilities to promote greater social bonding.},

At the same time, they see others playing at remote displays within the same virtual space. We are interested whether people would use such a public display media space, and if so, how and why. We evaluate Communiplay in a field study in six connected locations and find a remote honey-pot effect, i.e. people interacting at one location attract people at other locations. The conversion rate (percentage of passers-by starting to interact) rose by +136% when people saw others playing at remote locations. We also provide the first quantification of the (local) honey-pot effect (in our case it raised the conversion rate by +604% when people saw others playing at the same location). We conclude that the integration of multiple public displays into a media space is a promising direction for public displays and can make them more attractive and valuable.},

Smarties allows wall application developers to easily add interactive support to their collaborative applications. It consists of an interface running on touch mobile devices for input, a communication protocol between devices and the wall, and a library that implements the protocol and handles synchronization, locking and input conflicts. The library presents the input as an event loop with callback functions. Each touch mobile has multiple cursor controllers, each associated with keyboards, widgets and clipboards. These controllers can be assigned to specific tasks, are persistent in nature, and can be shared by multiple collaborating users for sharing work. They can control simple cursors on the wall application, or specific content (objects or groups of them). The types of associated widgets are decided by the wall application, making the mobile interface customizable by the wall application it connects to.},

A 12-week longitudinal data collection, including surveys and interviews, documents this shift, with participants beginning internships and full-time positions in UX. Students and early professionals were asked to assess their level of competence and factors that influenced competence. A co-construction of identity between the designer and their environment is proposed, with a variety of factors relating to tool and representational knowledge, complexity, and corporate culture influencing perceptions of competence in UX over time. Opportunities for future research, particularly in building an understanding of competency in UX based on this preliminary framing of early UX practice are addressed.},

This paper examines a large-scale mobile battery awareness application, called Carat, to see how it changes user behavior with long-term use. We conducted a survey of current Carat Android users and analyzed their interaction logs. The results show that long-term Carat users save more battery, charge their devices less often, learn to manage their battery with less help from Carat, have a better understanding of how Carat works, and may enjoy competing against other users. Based on these findings, we propose a set of guidelines for mobile battery awareness applications: battery awareness applications should make the reasoning behind their recommendations understandable to the user, be tailored to retain long-term users, take the audience into account when formulating feedback, and distinguish third-party and system applications.},

Interactive tabletops allow their users great flexibility in the manipulation of virtual objects but to our knowledge previous work has never examined whether prospective motor control takes place in this context. To test this, we ran three experiments. We systematically studied how users adapt their grasp when asked to translate and rotate virtual objects on a multitouch tabletop. Our results demonstrate that target position and orientation significantly affect the orientation of finger placement on the object. We analyze our results in the light of the most recent model of planning for manipulating physical objects and identify their implications for the design of tabletop interfaces. },

abstract = {To date, a variety of automated negotiation agents have been created. While each of these agents has been shown to be effective in negotiating with people in specific environments, they lack natural language processing support required to enable real-world types of interactions. In this paper we present NegoChat, the first negotiation agent that successfully addresses this limitation. NegoChat contains several significant research contributions. First, we found that simply modifying existing agents to include an NLP module is insufficient to create these agents. Instead, the agents' strategies must be modified to address partial agreements and issue-by-issue interactions. Second, we present NegoChat's negotiation algorithm. This algorithm is based on bounded rationality, and specifically Aspiration Adaptation Theory (AAT). As per AAT, issues are addressed based on people's typical urgency, or order of importance. If an agreement cannot be reached based on the value the human partner demands, the agent retreats, or downwardly lowers the value of previously agreed upon issues so that a ``good enough'' agreement can be reached on all issues. This incremental approach is fundamentally different from all other negotiation agents, including the state-of-the-art KBAgent. Finally, we present a rigorous evaluation of NegoChat, showing its effectiveness.},

abstract = {Link quality estimation is a fundamental component of the low-power wireless network protocols and is essential for routing protocols in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). However, accurate link quality estimation remains a challenging task due to the notoriously dynamic and unpredictable wireless environment. In this article we argue that, in addition to the estimation of current link quality, prediction of the future link quality is more important for the routing protocol to establish low-cost delivery paths. We propose to apply machine learning methods to predict the link quality in the near future to facilitate the utilization of intermediate links with frequent quality changes. Moreover, we show that, by using online learning methods, our adaptive link estimator (TALENT) adapts to network dynamics better than statically trained models without the need of a priori data collection for training the model before deployment. We implemented TALENT in TinyOS with Low-Power Listening (LPL) and conducted extensive experiments in three testbeds. Our experimental results show that the addition of TALENT increases the delivery efficiency 1.95 times on average compared with a 4B, state-of-the-art link quality estimator, as well as improves the end-to-end delivery rate when tested on three different wireless testbeds.},

abstract = {With the enormous growth of Android mobile devices and the huge increase in the number of published applications (apps), Short Message Service (SMS) is becoming an important issue. SMS can be abused by attackers when they send SMS spam, transfer all command and control (C&amp;C) instructions, launch denial-of-service (DoS) attacks to send premium-rate SMS messages without user permission, and propagate malware via URLs sent within SMS messages. Thus, SMS has to be reliable as well as secure. In this paper, we propose a SMS botnet detection framework that uses multi-agent technology based on observations of SMS and Android smartphone features. This system detects SMS botnets and identifies ways to block the attacks in order to prevent damage caused by these attacks. An adaptive hybrid model of SMS botnet detectors is being developed by using a combination of signature-based and anomaly-based methods. The model is designed to recognize malicious SMS messages by applying behavioural analysis to find the correlation between suspicious SMS messages and reported profiling. Behaviour profiles of Android smartphones are being created to carry out robust and efficient anomaly detection. A multi-agent system technology was selected to perform light-weight detection without exhausting smartphone resources such as battery and memory.},

This position paper discusses the security threats that may result from introducing multiagent technology in such intelligent transportation systems. We argue that, while multi-agent approaches have a major role to play in this domain, their introduction in vehicle-to-vehicle communication or autonomous driving systems raises new security challenges that must be addressed by both cyber-security and multi-agent research.},

The goal of this empirical study is to understand the nature and impact of these discrepancies by a detailed analysis of the design and code artifacts. The case study is based on an object-oriented software development project based on a traditional plan-driven software development process and proposed by an industrial collaborator. Case study results show that the code written is based on different sources. Software components can be created from scratch, added after design, adapted from the redesign of a reused component or implemented from the modification of an existing component. It is found that code components based on design artifacts are indeed victims of erosion once implementation begins. This erosion can be linked to the evolution of the team members' project understanding during implementation. However, the study concludes that this evolution is mostly opportunistic and does not necessarily warrant an evolution toward amelioration. This study proposes a quality control practice based on the category of the implemented components.},

One challenge for IaaS customers is the correct provisioning of their resources. Many users end up underprovisioning, hurting application performance, or overprovisioning, paying for resources that are not really necessary. Memory is an essential resource for any computing system, and is frequently a nperformance-limiting factor in cloud environments. In this work, we propose a model that enables cloud customers to determine whether the memory allocated to their virtual machines is correctly provisioned, underprovisioned, or overprovisioned. The model uses two metrics collected inside a VM, resident and committed memory, and defines thresholds for these metrics that characterize each provisioning level. Experimental results with Linux guests on Xen, running four benchmarks with different workloads and varying memory capacity, show that the model was able to accurately diagnose memory provisioning in 98% of the scenarios evaluated.},

abstract = {Physical activity is beneficial in chronic pain rehabilitation. However, due to psychological anxieties about pain and the percevied risk of injury, physical activity is often avoided by people with chronic pain. This avoidance is expressed through self protective body movement aimed at avoiding strain, particularly in painful areas. The detection of protective behaviour is crucial for effective rehabilitation advice and to enable a more normal lifestyle. Current technology to motivate physical activity in rehabilitation contexts does not address these psychological barriers. In this paper, we investigate the automatic recognition of a specific form of protective behaviour, guarding, common in people with chronic lower back pain. We trained ensembles of decision trees, Random Forests, on posture and velocity based features from motion capture and electromyographic data. Results show overall out of bag F1-classification scores of 0.81 and 0.73 for sitting to standing and one leg stand exercises respectively.},

abstract = {Stress is considered to be a modern day "global epidemic"; so given the widespread nature of this problem, it would be beneficial if solutions that help people to learn how to cope better with stress were scalable beyond what individual or group therapies can provide today. Therefore, in this work, we study the potential of smart-phones as a pervasive medium to provide therapy for the general population - "popular therapy". The work melds two novel contributions: first, a micro-intervention authoring process that focuses on repurposing popular web applications as stress management interventions; and second, a machine-learning based intervention recommender system that learns how to match interventions to individuals and their temporal circumstances over time. After four weeks, participants in our user study reported higher self-awareness of stress, lower depression-related symptoms and having learned new simple ways to deal with stress. Furthermore, participants receiving the machine-learning recommendations without option to select different ones showed a tendency towards using more constructive coping behaviors.},

abstract = {Parenting is always demanding, but families coping with neurodevelopmental disorders, such as ADHD, experience unique challenges. To address these challenges, research in the area of Parental Behavioral Therapy is accelerating. This type of therapy focuses on behavioral strategies that, if practiced regularly, can have a positive impact on the child's long-term behavior, as well as a reduction in parental stress. While these strategies are simple, there are hurdles to putting them into practice. First, parents often struggle with their own---often-undiagnosed---mental health challenges. Second, due to the needs of their children, parents are under immense stress in addition to regular, daily life stresses. Our work explores how to monitor parental stress and offers in situ support to remind parents of behavioral strategies to practice in moments of duress. We gained insight into how to design for the dynamics of families with ADHD children by using a prototype of our system as a probe. Our goal was to bring to the forefront simple strategies that can positively impact family ties and enhance the wellbeing of the child. We present results that suggest that when interventions are cued during moments of duress, technology might prove useful in supporting behavioral therapy.},

abstract = {Body Sensor Networks (BSNs) are playing an important role in the ongoing revolution of the health-care system, introducing the domain of the so-called m-Health. The integration of BSN applications with Cloud-computing technologies is an emerging approach, promising to favor the diffusion of many m-Health services in real life. Among them, motor rehabilitation is one of the application areas where this is particularly true. Monitoring rehabilitation patients via communication networks and mobile computing systems is a crucial aspect since the idea of tying the opportunity to follow and monitor the patient at all post-admission stages through remote monitoring allows to substantially reduce the costs associated with the process. On the other hand, patients that can safely perform rehabilitation and be monitored remotely will get benefit in terms of comfort, physical stress, and economic cost. This paper introduces a motor rehabilitation digital assistant, called Rehab-aaService, based on a three-tier architecture that includes wearable motion sensor nodes, a personal mobile device, and a Cloud-based back-end supported by the BodyCloud middleware.},

abstract = {Here we present the final analysis result of e-ESAS, a mobile based symptom monitoring and management system for terminally ill breast cancer (BC) patients in rural Bangladesh. These patients need palliative care support whose goal is to meet patients' social, spiritual and psychological needs as well as alleviating pain and other symptoms. But in the context of rural Bangladesh, doctors find it very difficult to control even the most significant symptom 'pain' due to a lack of history of symptom data. In this scenario we have deployed e-ESAS which has been used by 10 patients to submit symptom values from their home for 10 months (Nov '11- Sep '12). Our results show how e-ESAS with motivational videos not only helped the patients to have a 'dignified' life but also helped the doctors to achieve the goals of palliative care. Also the analyzed results are shown in 4 categories to appropriately measure the contribution of e-ESAS in improving the quality of life (QoL) of the patients.},

The study was conducted adopting a human-centred approach; employing focus groups and individual interviews with older adults, professional caregivers and psychologists specialized in the aging process. Results indicated that users were in favour of a virtual companion and highlighted its potential to assist the accomplishment of daily activities and make more efficient use of human care services. Humanlike communication and behaviour were desirable whereas mixed opinions were expressed about humanlike appearance. The ramifications of the study are discussed in the form of design implications for the development of a virtual assistive companion that possesses the appropriate "social skills" to establish and maintain comfortable and acceptable long-term interaction and offers "useful" support to older adults.},

abstract = {A significant problem with electronic health records (EHRs) has been their failure to fit into existing workflows because they do not support informal documentation and communication. We used qualitative fieldwork and participatory design to investigate how EHRs could be designed to meet these needs. The contributions of this work are twofold: we identified and described the informal processes of documentation and communication that we refer to as collaborative reflection, and then developed design recommendations for EHRs to support these existing workflows. We studied treatment teams providing behavioral and mental health services as part of integrated school programs for children with special needs. To make ongoing treatment decisions, team members document progress daily and communicate frequently with one another. Based on our fieldwork findings, we describe this process of collaborative reflection as (1) unstructured, (2) mobile, (3) reciprocally interdependent, and (4) long-term. We engaged the treatment teams in a participatory design process to understand how EHRs could be designed to fit this process, culminating in seven design recommendations. Our work suggests that by supporting the process of collaborative reflection, EHR-related information technology could significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of treatment teams.},

abstract = {The expansion of the mobile applications in various domains has opened the issue of the optimal usage of the limited resources (e.g. data storage capacity and processing power). This is especially important for the so-called data-intensive applications, which deal with huge amount of mobile data, like in the case of m-Health (i.e. wearable sensing). Many of these applications are oriented towards detecting of particular real-time situations, which brings them to the domain of Event Processing. However, we argue that real-time, big data driven applications require a novel infrastructure for distributed complex event processing that is only partially executed on the mobile devices. This tutorial paper presents a foundation for an efficient development of such mobile applications, by introducing a mobile-driven distributed CEP infrastructure. We present the technical details of the infrastructure and its initial implementation.},

abstract = {In this paper we present an application of the mobile-based distributed complex event processing for the collaborative remote person monitoring, a novel approach for the e-Health and Fitness domain that represents a kind of breakthrough for these domains. Indeed, so far remote monitoring has been focused on one individual person: the monitored person is equipped (wears) a sensor that sends data to the user's smartphone for storage, local (simple) analysis and upload to the server, where the data can be visualized and analyzed on request in off-line mode. Our, new, approach extends this processing pipeline with a) real-time feedback from the server-side processing in order to enable the detection of very complex situations and b) distribution of processing between several nodes (persons) in order to enable collaboration in detecting mentioned complex situations.The approach is applied in the development of the commercial solution for remote patient monitoring used in monitoring of the physical activities of grouped cardio patients in order to support collaborative detection of complex situations.In this paper we present the theoretical background of the approach and detail some most innovative elements. In addition we discuss the results from an ongoing piloting of this technology in a real healthcare environment: two hospitals.We argue that this approach opens many other opportunities to exploit collaborative potential of patient/person monitoring in various domains.},

abstract = {As high-end systems move toward exascale sizes, a new model of scientific inquiry being developed is one in which online data analytics run concurrently with the high end simulations producing data outputs. Goals are to gain rapid insights into the ongoing scientific processes, assess their scientific validity, and/or initiate corrective or supplementary actions by launching additional computations when needed. The Flexpath system presented in this paper addresses the fundamental problem of how to structure and efficiently implement the communications between high end simulations and concurrently running online data analytics, the latter comprised of componentized dynamic services and service pipelines.Using a type-based publish/subscribe approach, Flexpath encourages diversity by permitting analytics services to differ in their computational and scaling characteristics and even in their internal execution models. Flexpath uses direct and MxN connections between interacting services to reduce data movements, to allow for runtime connectivity changes to accommodate component arrivals/departures, and to support the multiple underlying communication protocols used for analytics workflows in which simulation outputs are processed by analytics services residing on the same nodes where they are generated, on the same machine, and/or on attached or remote analytics engines. This paper describes the design and implementation of Flexpath, and evaluates it with two widely used scientific applications and their associated data analytics methods.},

abstract = {The easily-accessible computation power offered by cloud infrastructures coupled with the revolution of Big Data are expanding the scale and speed at which data analysis is performed. In their quest for finding the Value in the 3 Vs of Big Data, applications process larger data sets, within and across clouds. Enabling fast data transfers across geographically distributed sites becomes particularly important for applications which manage continuous streams of events in real time. Scientific applications (e.g. the Ocean Observatory Initiative or the ATLAS experiment) as well as commercial ones (e.g. Microsoft's Bing and Office 365 large-scale services) operate on tens of data-centers around the globe and follow similar patterns: they aggregate monitoring data, assess the QoS or run global data mining queries based on inter site event stream processing. In this paper, we propose a set of strategies for efficient transfers of events between cloud data-centers and we introduce JetStream: a prototype implementing these strategies as a high performance batch-based streaming middleware. JetStream is able to self-adapt to the streaming conditions by modeling and monitoring a set of context parameters. It further aggregates the available bandwidth by enabling multi-route streaming across cloud sites. The prototype was validated on tens of nodes from US and Europe data-centers of the Windows Azure cloud using synthetic benchmarks and with application code from the context of the Alice experiment at CERN. The results show an increase in transfer rate of 250 times over individual event streaming. Besides, introducing an adaptive transfer strategy brings an additional 25% gain. Finally, the transfer rate can further be tripled thanks to the use of multi-route streaming.},

abstract = {The annual electricity consumed by data transfers in the U.S. is estimated to be 20 Terawatt hours, which translates to around 4 billion U.S. Dollars per year. There has been considerable amount of prior work looking at power management and energy efficiency in hardware and software systems, and more recently in power-aware networking. Despite the growing body of research in power management techniques for the networking infrastructure, there has been no prior work (to the best of our knowledge), focusing on saving energy at the end-systems (sender and receiver nodes) during the data transfer. We argue that although network-only approaches are part of the solution, the end-system power management is a key in optimizing energy efficiency of the data transfers, which has been long ignored. In this paper, we analyze various factors that will affect the power consumption in end-to-end data transfers, such as the level of parallelism, concurrency and pipelining. Our results show that significant amount of energy savings can be achieved at the end-systems during data transfer with no or minimal performance penalty.},

abstract = {Virtualization promised to dramatically increase server utilization levels, yet many data centers are still only lightly loaded. In some ways, big data applications are an ideal fit for using this residual capacity to perform meaningful work, but the high level of interference between interactive and batch processing workloads currently prevents this from being a practical solution in virtualized environments. Further, the variable nature of spare capacity may make it difficult to meet big data application deadlines.In this work we propose two schedulers: one in the virtualization layer designed to minimize interference on high priority interactive services, and one in the Hadoop framework that helps batch processing jobs meet their own performance deadlines. Our approach uses performance models to match Hadoop tasks to the servers that will benefit them the most, and deadline-aware scheduling to effectively order incoming jobs. The combination of these schedulers allows data center administrators to safely mix resource intensive Hadoop jobs with latency sensitive web applications, and still achieve predictable performance for both. We have implemented our system using Xen and Hadoop, and our evaluation shows that our schedulers allow a mixed cluster to reduce web response times by more than ten fold, while meeting more Hadoop deadlines and lowering total task execution times by 6.5%.},

All workloads may potentially share the same data store, some of them consuming data for analytics purposes while others acting as data generators. This kind of scenario is becoming increasingly important in data centers where improved resource utilization can be achieved through workload consolidation, and is specially challenging due to the interaction between workloads of different nature that compete for limited resources. The proposed scheduler aims to improve resource utilization across machines while observing completion time goals. Unlike other MapReduce schedulers, our approach also takes into account the resource demands for non-MapReduce workloads, and assumes that the amount of resources made available to the MapReduce applications is variable over time. As shown in our experiments, our proposal improves the management of MapReduce jobs in the presence of variable resource availability, increasing the accuracy of the estimations made by the scheduler, thus improving completion time goals without an impact on the fairness of the scheduler.},

abstract = {Smart healthcare is a complex domain for systems integration due to human and technical factors and heterogeneous data sources involved. As a part of smart city, it is such a complex area where clinical functions require smartness of multi-systems collaborations for effective communications among departments, and radiology is one of the areas highly relies on intelligent information integration and communication. Therefore, it faces many challenges regarding integration and its interoperability such as information collision, heterogeneous data sources, policy obstacles, and procedure mismanagement. The purpose of this study is to conduct an analysis of data, semantic, and pragmatic interoperability of systems integration in radiology department, and to develop a pragmatic interoperability framework for guiding the integration. We select an on-going project at a local hospital for undertaking our case study. The project is to achieve data sharing and interoperability among Radiology Information Systems (RIS), Electronic Patient Record (EPR), and Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS). Qualitative data collection and analysis methods are used. The data sources consisted of documentation including publications and internal working papers, one year of non-participant observations and 37 interviews with radiologists, clinicians, directors of IT services, referring clinicians, radiographers, receptionists and secretary. We identified four primary phases of data analysis process for the case study: requirements and barriers identification, integration approach, interoperability measurements, and knowledge foundations. Each phase is discussed and supported by qualitative data. Through the analysis we also develop a pragmatic interoperability framework that summaries the empirical findings and proposes recommendations for guiding the integration in the radiology context.},

abstract = {Grid applications are more and more widely used nowadays. One of the major challenges is to provide a reliable and predictable platform for computations of various kinds. In order to overcome this challenge, Grid management systems such as the virtual resource manager (VRM) implement scheduling and mapping algorithms at level of the local management systems with support for resource reservation in advance. In this paper, we examine three different mapping algorithms for supercomputers and cluster systems with respect to execution time and the achieveable performance regarding important metrics such as overall Manhattan distance and achievable utilization. The results show the importance of carefully implementing scheduling and mapping algorithms in Grid environments.},

abstract = {Task scheduling and execution over large scale, distributed systems plays an important role on achieving good performance and high system utilization. Due to the explosion of parallelism found in today's hardware, applications need to perform over-decomposition to deliver good performance; this over-decomposition is driving job management systems' requirements to support applications with a growing number of tasks with finer granularity. Our goal in this work is to provide a compact, light-weight, scalable, and distributed task execution framework (CloudKon) that builds upon cloud computing building blocks (Amazon EC2, SQS, and DynamoDB). Most of today's state-of-the-art job execution systems have predominantly Master/Slaves architectures, which have inherent limitations, such as scalability issues at extreme scales and single point of failures. On the other hand distributed job management systems are complex, and employ non-trivial load balancing algorithms to maintain good utilization. CloudKon is a distributed job management system that can support both HPC and MTC workloads with millions of tasks/jobs. We compare our work with other state-of-the-art job management systems including Sparrow and MATRIX. The results show that CloudKon delivers better scalability compared to other state-of-the-art systems for some metrics - all with a significantly smaller code-base (5%).},

abstract = {Detection and identification of important biological targets such as, DNA, proteins, and diseased human cells is crucial towards early disease diagnosis and prognosis. The key to differentiate healthy cells from the diseased cells is the biophysical properties that differ significantly. Micro and nanosystems, such as solid-state micropores and nanopores, can measure and translate these properties of human cells and DNA into electrical spikes to decode useful biological insights. Nonetheless, such approaches result in large data streams that are often plagued with inherit noise and baseline wanders. Moreover, the extant detection approaches are tedious, time-consuming, and error-prone, and there is no error-resilient software that can analyze large datasets instantly. The ability to effectively process and detect biological targets in larger datasets lies in the automated and accelerated data processing strategies using state-of-the-art distributed computing systems. To this end, we propose a distributed detection framework, which collects the raw data stream on a server node that then splits/distributes the data into segments across the worker nodes. Each node reduces noise in the assigned data segment using moving-average filtering, and detects the electric spikes by comparing them against a statistical threshold (based on the mean and standard deviation of the data), in a Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD) style. Our proposed framework enables the detection of cancer cells with an accuracy of 63% in a mixture of Cancer cells, Red Blood Cells (RBCs), and White Blood Cells (WBCs), and achieves a maximum speedup of 6X over a single-node machine by processing 10 gigabytes of raw data using an 8-node cluster in less than a minute.},

The model, called Process-oriented Event Model (PoEM), provides a formal approach to model real-world entities and their interrelationships, and specifies the process of moving from data streams to event detection to event-based goal planning. The model links event detection to states, actions, and roles, enabling event notification, filtering, context awareness and escalation. PoEM defines event and non-event concepts and combines information from them to build an event processing workflow. Usage of the PoEM model is illustrated in case studies from the oil and gas industry and maritime piracy events.},

abstract = {High performance computing systems are today composed of tens of thousands of processors and deep memory hierarchies. The next generation of machines will further increase the unbalance between I/O capabilities and processing power. To reduce the pressure on I/Os, the in situ analytics paradigm proposes to process the data as closely as possible to where and when the data are produced. Processing can be embedded in the simulation code, executed asynchronously on helper cores on the same nodes, or performed in transit on staging nodes dedicated to analytics. Today, software environnements as well as usage scenarios still need to be investigated before in situ analytics become a standard practice.In this paper we introduce a framework for designing, deploying and executing in situ scenarios. Based on a component model, the scientist designs analytics workflows by first developing processing components that are next assembled in a dataflow graph through a Python script. At runtime the graph is instantiated according to the execution context, the framework taking care of deploying the application on the target architecture and coordinating the analytics workflows with the simulation execution. Component coordination, zero-copy intra-node communications or inter-nodes data transfers rely on per-node distributed daemons.We evaluate various scenarios performing in situ and in transit analytics on large molecular dynamics systems simulated with Gromacs using up to 2048 cores. We show in particular that analytics processing can be performed on the fraction of resources the simulation does not use well, resulting in a limited impact on the simulation performance (less than 9%). Our more advanced scenario combines in situ and in transit processing to compute a molecular surface based on the Quicksurf algorithm.},

Elderly people prefer to live as independently as possible at home, but living independently has its risks, such as falling, weakening bodies, memory loss, and wandering that limit mobility and activities. Basic functions like walking and sleeping are key indicators in determining the performance of an elderly person's home activities. For this reason a low cost, smart and real-time home monitoring system has been developed to collect individual mobility data (walking, sleeping, and going to the washroom) and warns formal or informal caregivers immediately when there is a dangerous event or motor behavior impairment. This paper reports on our current trials of a monitoring system in an Alzheimer's unit to determine the mobility behavior of some patients.},

The proposal follows a user-centric approach and provides an integrative platform for evaluators to gather more information. This platform is characterized by a reusable enquiry module, its ability for real time monitoring and a event-driven dynamic module for adaptable evaluation processes.

abstract = {Bipolar Disorder is a disease that is manifested with cycling periods of polar episodes, namely mania and depression. Depressive episodes are manifested through disturbed mood, psychomotor retardation, behaviour change, decrease in energy levels and length of sleep. Manic episodes are manifested through elevated mood, psychomotor acceleration and increase in intensity of social interactions. In this paper we report results of a clinical trial with bipolar patients that amongst other aspects, investigated whether changes in general behaviour of patients due to onset of a bipolar episode, can be captured through the analysis of smartphone usage. We have analysed changes in smartphone usage, specifically app usage and how these changes correlate with the self-reported patient state. We also used psychiatric evaluation scores provided by the clinic to understand correlation of the patient smartphone behaviour before the psychiatric evaluation and after the psychiatric evaluation. The results show that patients have strong correlation of patterns of app usage with different aspects of their self-reported state including mood, sleep and irritability. While, on the other hand, the patients' application usage shows discernable changes in the period before and after psychiatric evaluation.},

abstract = {Diminished vigilance caused by fatigue, stress, and excessive mental load have been cited as a major cause for most aviation accidents. The job of an Air Traffic Controller (ATC) includes helping pilots maintain safe distances between planes, avoid all obstacles, as well as safe landing and takeoff. Unfortunately, the ATC work environment along with extended hours and overtime consistently results in widespread fatigued Air Traffic Controllers. Similarly, distracted, and fatigued drivers are also the cause of an increasing number of traffic related accidents and deaths. Dynamic working conditions along with the user's physical and emotional state have significant impact upon the usability and security of the system. In order to address this problem we present a Cognitive and Context-Aware Framework (CCF) that determines user's affective state, cognitive load, and context information. This enables applications to make real-time decisions to improve usability, security, or simply enhance user experience. The CCF framework constantly captures and analyzes user's biometric data (e.g. pupillometric indices of cognitive load), environmental analysis, location and time. The CCF can be used to develop a variety of applications that want to make decisions based upon user's current affective states and context. The application's decisions can be as simple as alerting a supervisor in the event an ATC is found to be fatigued/sleepy or disable critical functionality. The CCF also has applications in the gaming industry, healthcare, and advertisement. In this paper, we present the overview of the framework along with a dynamically adaptable user interface as an example of CCF application.},

abstract = {Serious games for elderly healthcare provide a promising and novel way to promote the well-being of senior citizens. The gaming environment, originally designed for a younger target population, benefits from the increasing power of personal computers, mobiles devices (phones, tablets) and SmartTVs, as well as the recent emergence of motion capture technology developed for videogame consoles via worn physical sensors and controller free sensors. Measuring self-efficacy by elderly individuals on such gaming environments has characterized them in terms of their effectiveness to motivate an audience reluctant to undertake more conventional forms of activities. However, the relationship between the features making the game challenging and the senior user's behaviour in becoming motivated so as to interact with the system independently and effectively is still elusive. For instance, failure in understanding the game's instructions or adapting to the speed and complexity may be thought of as barriers that affect the seniors' satisfactory interaction within the gaming environment. A step towards this direction would require using emotions in the midst of the gaming environment so as to allow for the embodiment of real-time mental (cognitive and emotional), and physical data. The main goal is to focus on assessing the features that encourage the elderly individuals to interact with the gaming environment on a daily basis. We propose to further enhance the gaming environment through the use of personal biosensors (i.e. wireless EEG) and cameras (i.e. fisheye camera) so as to collect the user's mental and physical changes over time and fuse them in a decision support system. This information will eventually provide feedback on the gaming experience so as to modify it according to the user's affective state.},

abstract = {Despite the wide dissemination and acceptance of teleworking in the IT industry, companies like Yahoo!, HP, or Best Buy have stopped their telework programs, which indicates that there might also be some negative side effects in this type of work. In regard to this, our research focuses on one particular negative side of teleworking by focusing on teleworking-induced stress of IT professionals. We theorize that teleworking-induced stressors influence IT personnel's psychological and behavioral strain in the form of exhaustion due to teleworking and discontinuous intention towards teleworking. Results of an empirical online survey with 57 IT professionals validate these dependencies, which gives us the grounds to identify work overload, work-home conflict, information underload, and social isolation as influence factors of exhaustion due to teleworking. Further results reveal that discontinuous intentions towards teleworking is directly influenced by social isolation and exhaustion due to teleworking, whereas the influence of work overload is mediated by exhaustion due to teleworking. Work overload due to telework has the strongest effect on exhaustion due to teleworking, which in turn is the strongest influence factor on the discontinuous intention towards teleworking.},

Our analyses resulted in a list of 145 questions grouped into 12 categories. The second survey asked a different pool of software engineers to rate these 145 questions and identify the most important ones to work on first. Respondents favored questions that focus on how customers typically use their applications. We also saw opposition to questions that assess the performance of individual employees or compare them with one another. Our categorization and catalog of 145 questions can help researchers, practitioners, and educators to more easily focus their efforts on topics that are important to the software industry. },

abstract = { Software developers make programming mistakes that cause serious bugs for their customers. Existing work to detect problematic software focuses mainly on post hoc identification of correlations between bug fixes and code. We propose a new approach to address this problem --- detect when software developers are experiencing difficulty while they work on their programming tasks, and stop them before they can introduce bugs into the code.  In this paper, we investigate a novel approach to classify the difficulty of code comprehension tasks using data from psycho-physiological sensors. We present the results of a study we conducted with 15 professional programmers to see how well an eye-tracker, an electrodermal activity sensor, and an electroencephalography sensor could be used to predict whether developers would find a task to be difficult. We can predict nominal task difficulty (easy/difficult) for a new developer with 64.99% precision and 64.58% recall, and for a new task with 84.38% precision and 69.79% recall. We can improve the Naive Bayes classifier's performance if we trained it on just the eye-tracking data over the entire dataset, or by using a sliding window data collection schema with a 55 second time window. Our work brings the community closer to a viable and reliable measure of task difficulty that could power the next generation of programming support tools. },
