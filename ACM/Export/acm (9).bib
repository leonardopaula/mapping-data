abstract = {The success of Skype has inspired a generation of peer-to-peer-based solutions for real-time multimedia services over the Internet. However, there lacks still a robust metric quantifying the perceptual quality of a Skype call. The widely-used PESQ (Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality) falls short of modeling super-wideband calls, which are characteristics of SILK Skype's codec made public in 2011. Towards a robust QoE (Quality of Experience) metric for VoIP call analysis, we propose a model, referred to as WF-Regression model, to capture the call rate and perceptual quality relationship. The model is shown through a user study that it is robust, R-square = 0.9990 and outperform PESQ modeling the quality of Skype calls, error ratio = 3.68% vs. 14.59%.},

abstract = {Cloud computing has captured the attention of both the researchers and practitioners alike. Companies and other cloud users are expecting to receive significant benefits from the new cloud based technologies. To what extent these benefits materialize for enterprise IT is not clearly understood. In this paper, we examine the perceived benefits of cloud computing from the cloud users' perspectives. Cloud users include users of SaaS/PaaS/IaaS, ranging from end-users, to service developers and system administrators. Using content analysis techniques, we examine one of the major discussion forums of cloud computing. Rather than offering a yes/no answer to the question posed, we offer five empirically drawn insights on the perceived benefits of cloud computing. It is proposed that the empirical insights gained are valuable to both researchers and practitioners. The value lies in a more holistic view on the promised benefits' landscape.},

abstract = {One emerging facet of e-government is Internet voting, or i-voting. I-voting refers to the secure transmission of a ballot via the Internet. This phenomenon has the potential to increase citizen participation in the democratic process. However, few studies have identified the unique characteristics that make i-voting an appealing option. In particular, there Is a need for research that identifies the impacts of both technological and political factors on intentions to use an Internet voting system. In this study, we propose a model inclusive of technological, situational and political factors. To test the model we administer a survey to a diverse pool of citizens with regards to age, income, and education. Results indicate that relative advantage and trust of the Internet impact intentions to use Internet voting, while party mobilization and political interest impact propensity to vote. Further, it was found that perceived Internet accessibility impacts the perceived convenience of voting online, which in turn impacts the perceived relative advantage of online voting. Implications of these findings for research and practice are discussed. We conclude with recommendations for future research. As local and state governments begin to experiment with internet voting, now is the time to identify the Internet-specific characteristics that will attract non-voters and retain habitual voters.},

Our model enables us to understand the psychology of the users and the external factors affecting them and sheds light on how non-active users are stuck in a negative loop. Users that received a support service designed on our model dramatically changed their attitude and started to use the service actively.},

In spite of the lack of background literature on how drawings can generate useful insights on HCI issues, drawings have been successfully used in other research fields. On the contrary, drama workshops seem to be increasingly popular in recent participatory design research. After briefly introducing such previous work, three case studies are presented, illustrating the use of drawing and drama workshops when investigating the relationship between media technology users and two specific devices, namely televisions and mobile phones. The paper focuses on the methods and discusses their benefits and the challenges associated with their application. In particular, the findings are compared to those collected through a quantitative cross-cultural survey. The experience gathered during the three case studies is very encouraging and calls for additional reports of UX evaluations involving drawing- and theatre-based exercises.},

abstract = {At the core of the healthcare crisis is a fundamental lack of actionable data, needed to stratify individuals within populations, to predict which persons have which outcomes. A new health system with better health management will require better health measurement, to improve cost and quality. It is now possible to use new technologies to provide the rich datasets necessary for adequate health measurement, which enables new information systems for new health systems.This report is a summary of a workshop on Measuring Data for Population Health, sponsored by the NSF SmartHealth program with assistance from the NIH mHealth initiative, held on January 12--13, 2012 in Washington DC. There were 42 attendees, including invited researchers from academia, government and industry, plus program officers from NSF and NIH.The workshop had background talks by leaders in health systems and information systems, followed by breakout discussions on future challenges and opportunities in measuring and managing population health. This report describes the observations on what problems of health systems should be addressed and what solutions of information systems should be developed. The recommendations cover how new information technologies can enable new health systems, with support from future initiatives of federal programs.The workshop and its report identify research challenges that utilize new computing and information technologies to enable better measurement and management for practical healthcare. The measurement technologies focus on deeper monitoring of broader populations. The management technologies focus on utilizing new personal health records to provide personalized treatment guidelines, specialized for each population cohort. This would enable predictive modeling for health systems to support viable healthcare at acceptable cost and quality.A workshop website contains background and discussion notes: https://wiki.engr.illinois.edu/display/hiworkshop/NSF+Workshop+Population+Health},

abstract = {We consider the problem of constructing efficient P2P overlays for sensornets providing "Energy-Level Application and Services". In this context, assuming that a sensor is responsible for executing some program task but unfortunately it's energy-level is lower than a pre-defined threshold. Then, this sensor should be able to introduce a query to the whole system in order to discover efficiently another sensor with the desired energy level, in which the task overhead must be eventually forwarded. In this way, the "Life-Expectancy" of the whole network could be increased. Sensor nodes are mapped to peers based on their energy level. As the energy levels change, the sensor nodes would have to move from one peer to another and this operation is very crucial for the efficient scalability of the proposed system. Similarly, as the energy level of a sensor node becomes extremely low, that node may want to forward it's task to another node with the desired energy level. The method presented in presents a novel P2P overlay for Energy Level discovery in a sensornet. However, this solution is not dynamic, since requires periodical restructuring. In particular, it is not able to support neither join of sensor_nodes with energy level out of the ranges supported by the existing p2p overlay nor leave of empty overlay_peers to which no sensor_nodes are currently associated. On this purpose and based on the efficient P2P method presented in [16], we design a dynamic P2P overlay for Energy Level discovery in a sensornet, the so-called SART (Sensors' Autonomous Range Tree). The adaptation of the P2P index presented in guarantees the best-known dynamic query performance of the above operation. We experimentally verify this performance, via the D-P2P-Sim simulator.},

Unlike previous attempts, this interactive storytelling system places no restrictions on the content or direction of the user’s contribution to the emerging storyline. In response to these contributions, the computer continues the storyline with narration that is both coherent and entertaining. This capacity for open-domain interactive storytelling is enabled by an extremely large repository of nonfiction personal stories, which is used as a knowledge base in a case-based reasoning architecture. In this article, we describe the three main components of our case-based reasoning approach: a million-item corpus of personal stories mined from internet weblogs, a case retrieval strategy that is optimized for narrative coherence, and an adaptation strategy that ensures that repurposed sentences from the case base are appropriate for the user’s emerging fiction. We describe a series of evaluations of the system’s ability to produce coherent and entertaining stories, and we compare these narratives with single-author stories posted to internet weblogs.},

abstract = {Music has been an inherent part of human life when it comes to recreation; entertainment and much recently, even as a therapeutic medium. Music is closely related to human emotions. We often choose to listen to a song or music which best fits our mood at that instant. The study of mood recognition in the field of music has gained a lot of momentum in the recent years with machine learning and data mining techniques contributing considerably to analyze and identify the relation of mood with music. We take the same inspiration forward and contribute by making an effort to build a system for automatic identification of mood underlying the audio songs by mining their spectral, temporal audio features. Our current work involves analysis of various classification algorithms in order to learn, train and test the model representing the moods of the audio songs. The focus is on the Indian popular music. The classification model was experimented using a set of 2300 distinct music clips. We have been successful to achieve a satisfactory precision of 70% to 75% in identifying the mood underlying the Indian popular music by introducing the bagging (ensemble) of random forest approach experimented over a total list of 2300 audio clips. We also propose the framework for including lyrics analysis along with audio feature analysis in order to strengthen the accuracy of predicting the mood of an audio file, implementation of which is still under experimentation.},

abstract = {E-commerce (Electronic Commerce) is a technique which deals with buying and selling of goods and services on the Internet. E-commerce is generally considered to be the sales aspect of electronic business. It generally deals with the exchange of data to facilitate the financing and payment aspects of business transactions. The main purpose of this paper is to present a scheme to employ database outsourcing protocol like Private Information Retrieval to develop an e-commerce application. Basically Private Information Retrieval (PIR) protocol allows a user to retrieve a record from a database while hiding the identity of the record from a database server. When the customer buys some products online, then customer has to fill the necessary details. These details may include the personal information regarding that customer and it may have the information such as credit card details. If this information is get leaked then there is a trouble created to the customer. To keep the information secret that means it is not going to understand to third party service provider, this system dealing with the PIR protocol. The use of PIR protocol within e-commerce applications would make it possible for a user to keep his preferences private from everybody including the server. In this paper we present a comprehensive discussion on the need to integrate PIR in e-commerce applications. This paper discusses about the implications of PIR protocol in current implementations and proposes a new design for e-commerce application using PIR. Also further extensions to the proposed protocol are discussed and given the suggestions for the same.},

abstract = {Socially Relevant Simulation Games (SRSG), a new medium for social interaction, based on real-world skills and skill development, creates a single gaming framework that connects both serious and casual players. Through a detailed case study this paper presents a design process and framework for SRSG, in the context of mixed-reality golf swing simulations. The "World of Golf" SRSG utilizes a real-time expert system to capture, analyze, and evaluate golf swing metrics combining swing data with players' backgrounds, e.g., golf-handicaps, to form individual profiles. Simulation and assessment modules provide the serious player with tools to build golf skills while allowing casual players to engage within a simulated social world. A framework that incorporates simulated golf competitions among these social agents is presented and validated by comparing the usage statistics of 10 PGA Golf Management (PGM) students with 10 non-PGM students.},

To address this challenge, we show how tools can be developed that allow users to identify extractable information while browsing and then control how that information should be extracted and stored in a personal library. The proposed approach is based on an extensible framework capable of using different kinds of markup to aid the extraction process and a unique fusion of several well-established techniques from areas such as the semantic web, data warehousing, web scraping and web feeds.

abstract = {Stress can have long term adverse effects on individuals' physical and mental well-being. Changes in the speech production process is one of many physiological changes that happen during stress. Microphones, embedded in mobile phones and carried ubiquitously by people, provide the opportunity to continuously and non-invasively monitor stress in real-life situations. We propose StressSense for unobtrusively recognizing stress from human voice using smartphones. We investigate methods for adapting a one-size-fits-all stress model to individual speakers and scenarios. We demonstrate that the StressSense classifier can robustly identify stress across multiple individuals in diverse acoustic environments: using model adaptation StressSense achieves 81% and 76% accuracy for indoor and outdoor environments, respectively. We show that StressSense can be implemented on commodity Android phones and run in real-time. To the best of our knowledge, StressSense represents the first system to consider voice based stress detection and model adaptation in diverse real-life conversational situations using smartphones.},

Despite the great potential in physiological stress recognition, there are some critical issues that need to be addressed such as the sensitivity and variability of physiology to many factors other than stress (e.g., physical activity). To resolve these issues, in this paper, we focus on the understanding of physiological responses to both stressor and physical activity and perform stress recognition, particularly in situations having multiple stimuli: physical activity and stressors. We construct stress models that correspond to individual situations, and we validate our stress modeling in the presence of physical activity. Analysis of our experiments provides an understanding on how physiological responses change with different stressors and how physical activity confounds stress recognition with physiological responses. In both objective and subjective settings, the accuracy of stress recognition drops by more than 14% when physical activity is performed. However, by modularizing stress models with respect to physical activity, we can recognize stress with accuracies of 82% (objective stress) and 87% (subjective stress), achieving more than a 5-10% improvement from approaches that do not take physical activity into account.},

After presenting the system design, a feasibility study on weeks of continuous inertial data from 6 participants investigates both accuracy and execution speed of each of the abstraction and detection steps. Results show that our method is able to detect target activities in a large data set with a comparable precision and recall to more conventional approaches, in approximately the time it takes to download and visualize the logs from the sensor.},

The convenient control over the system combined with limitations of the technology may have prevented the desired energy savings.

Using simulated data of episodes of severe behavior acted out by trained specialists, we demonstrate how machine learning techniques can be used to segment relevant behavioral episodes from a continuous sensor stream and to classify them into distinct categories of severe behavior (aggression, disruption, and self-injury). We further validate our approach by demonstrating it produces no false positives when applied to a publicly accessible dataset of activities of daily living. Finally, we show promising classification results when our sensing and analysis system is applied to data from a real assessment session conducted with a child exhibiting problem behaviors.},

In this paper, we experimentally and analytically investigate the design considerations that arise in the efficient use of the low power processor and provide a thorough understanding of the problem space. We answer fundamental questions such as which segments of the application are most efficient to be hosted on the low power processor, and how to select an appropriate low power processor.

abstract = {The capacity to gather and timely deliver to the service level any relevant information that can characterize the service-provisioning environment, such as computing resources/capabilities, physical device location, user preferences, and time constraints, usually defined as context-awareness, is widely recognized as a core function for the development of modern ubiquitous and mobile systems. Much work has been done to enable context-awareness and to ease the diffusion of context-aware services; at the same time, several middleware solutions have been designed to transparently implement context management and provisioning in the mobile system. However, to the best of our knowledge, an in-depth analysis of the context data distribution, namely, the function in charge of distributing context data to interested entities, is still missing. Starting from the core assumption that only effective and efficient context data distribution can pave the way to the deployment of truly context-aware services, this article aims at putting together current research efforts to derive an original and holistic view of the existing literature. We present a unified architectural model and a new taxonomy for context data distribution by considering and comparing a large number of solutions. Finally, based on our analysis, we draw some of the research challenges still unsolved and identify some possible directions for future work.},

abstract = {This paper presents a real-world pricing kernel for financial derivatives and evaluates the language and compiler tool chain that would allow expressive, hardware-neutral algorithm implementation and efficient execution on graphics-processing units (GPU). The language issues refer to preserving algorithmic invariants, e.g., inherent parallelism made explicit by map-reduce-scan functional combinators. Efficient execution is achieved by manually; applying a series of generally-applicable compiler transformations that allows the generated-OpenCL code to yield speedups as high as 70x and 540x on a commodity mobile and desktop GPU, respectively.Apart from the concrete speed-ups attained, our contributions are twofold: First, from a language perspective;, we illustrate that even state-of-the-art auto-parallelization techniques are incapable of discovering all the requisite data parallelism when rendering the functional code in Fortran-style imperative array processing form. Second, from a performance perspective;, we study which compiler transformations are necessary to map the high-level functional code to hand-optimized OpenCL code for GPU execution. We discover a rich optimization space with nontrivial trade-offs and cost models. Memory reuse in map-reduce patterns, strength reduction, branch divergence optimization, and memory access coalescing, exhibit significant impact individually. When combined, they enable essentially full utilization of all GPU cores.Functional programming has played a crucial double role in our case study: Capturing the naturally data-parallel structure of the pricing algorithm in a transparent, reusable and entirely hardware-independent fashion; and supporting the correctness of the subsequent compiler transformations to a hardware-oriented target language by a rich class of universally valid equational properties. Given the observed difficulty of automatically parallelizing imperative sequential code and the inherent labor of porting hardware-oriented and -optimized programs, our case study suggests that functional programming technology can facilitate high-level; expression of leading-edge performant portable; high-performance systems for massively parallel hardware architectures.},

Beginning with the principle that information security is necessary but not sufficient for privacy, we present an innovative layered framework - the Privacy Security Trust (PST) Framework - which integrates, in one model, the different activities practitioners must undertake for effective privacy practice. The PST Framework considers information security, information management and data protection legislation as privacy hygiene factors, representing the minimum processes for effective privacy practice. The framework also includes privacy influencers - developed from previous research in information security culture, information ethics and information culture - and privacy by design principles. The framework helps to deliver good privacy practice by providing: 1) a clear hierarchy of the activities needed for effective privacy practice; 2) delineation of information security and privacy; and 3) justification for placing data protection at the heart of those activities involved in maintaining information privacy. We present a proof-of-concept application of the PST Framework to an example technology -- electricity smart meters.},

abstract = {An increasing number of MapReduce applications associated with live business intelligence require completion time guarantees. In this paper, we consider the popular Pig framework that provides a high-level SQL-like abstraction on top of MapReduce engine for processing large data sets. Programs written in such frameworks are compiled into directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of MapReduce jobs. There is a lack of performance models and analysis tools for automated performance management of such MapReduce jobs. We offer a performance modeling environment for Pig programs that automatically profiles jobs from the past runs and aims to solve the following inter-related problems: (i) estimating the completion time of a Pig program as a function of allocated resources; (ii) estimating the amount of resources (a number of map and reduce slots) required for completing a Pig program with a given (soft) deadline. For solving these problems, initially, we optimize a Pig program execution by enforcing the optimal schedule of its concurrent jobs. For DAGs with concurrent jobs, this optimization helps reducing the program completion time: 10%-27% in our experiments. Moreover, it eliminates possible non-determinism of concurrent jobs' execution in the Pig program, and therefore, enables a more accurate performance model for Pig programs. We validate our approach using a 66-node Hadoop cluster and a diverse set of workloads: PigMix benchmark, TPC-H queries, and customized queries mining a collection of HP Labs' web proxy logs. The proposed scheduling optimization leads to significant resource savings(20%-40% in our experiments) compared with the original, unoptimized solution, and the predicted program completion times are within 10% of the measured ones.},

abstract = {Bi-section bandwidth is a critical resource in today's data centers because of the high cost and limited bandwidth of higher-level network switches and routers. This problem is aggravated in virtualized environments where a set of virtual machines, jointly implementing some service, may run across multiple L2 hops. Since data center administrators typically do not have visibility into such sets of communicating VMs, this can cause inter-VM traffic to traverse bottlenecked network paths. To address this problem, we present 'Net-Cohort', which offers lightweight system-level techniques to (1) discover VM ensembles and (2) collect information about intra-ensemble VM interactions. Net-Cohort can dynamically identify ensembles to manipulate entire services/applications rather than individual VMs, and to support VM placement engines in co-locating communicating VMs in order to reduce the consumption of bi-section bandwidth. An implementation of Net-Cohort on a Xen-based system with 15 hosts and 225 VMs shows that its methods can detect VM ensembles at low cost and with about 90.0% accuracy. Placements based on ensemble information provided by Net-Cohort can result in an up to 385% improvement in application throughput for a RUBiS instance, a 56.4% improvement in application throughput for a Hadoop instance, and a 12.76 times improvement in quality of service for a SIPp instance.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Software testing can be an arduous and expensive activity. A typical activity to maximise testing productivity is to allocate test cases according to the testers' profile. However, optimising the allocation of manual test cases is not a trivial task: in big companies, test managers are responsible for allocating hundreds of test cases among several testers. OBJECTIVE: In this paper we propose and evaluate 2 assignment algorithms for test case allocation and 3 tester profiles based on recommender systems. Each assignment algorithm can be combined with 3 tester profiles, which results in six possible allocation systems. METHOD: We run a controlled experiment that uses 100 test suites, each one with at least 50 test cases, from a real industrial setting in order to compare our allocation systems to the manager's allocation in terms of precision, recall and unassignment (percentage of test cases the algorithm could not allocate). RESULTS: In our experiment, the statistical analysis shows that one of the systems outperforms the others with respect to the precision and recall metrics. For unassignment, three of our six allocation systems achieved zero (best value) for the unassignment rate. CONCLUSION: The results of our experiment suggest that, in similar environments, test managers can use our allocation systems to reduce the amount of time spent in the test case allocation task. In the real industrial setting in which our work was developed, managers spend from 16 to 30 working days a year on test case allocation. Our algorithms can help them do it faster and better.},

abstract = {Context: Systems of systems (SoS) are highly complex and are integrated on multiple levels (unit, component, system, system of systems). Many of the characteristics of SoS (such as operational and managerial independence, integration of system into system of systems, SoS comprised of complex systems) make their development and testing challenging.Contribution: This paper provides an understanding of SoS testing in large-scale industry settings with respect to challenges and how to address them.Method: The research method used is case study research. As data collection methods we used interviews, documentation, and fault slippage data.Results: We identified challenges related to SoS with respect to fault slippage, test turn-around time, and test maintainability. We also classified the testing challenges to general testing challenges, challenges amplified by SoS, and challenges that are SoS specific. Interestingly, the interviewees agreed on the challenges, even though we sampled them with diversity in mind, which meant that the number of interviews conducted was sufficient to answer our research questions. We also identified solution proposals to the challenges that were categorized under four classes of developer quality assurance, function test, testing in all levels, and requirements engineering and communication.Conclusion: We conclude that although over half of the challenges we identified can be categorized as general testing challenges still SoS systems have their unique and amplified challenges stemming from SoS characteristics. Furthermore, it was found that interviews and fault slippage data indicated that different areas in the software process should be improved, which indicates that using only one of these methods would have led to an incomplete picture of the challenges in the case company.},

Most passersby did not pay attention to the participants and vice versa. A comparative laboratory experiment revealed only few differences in system usage.},

Ten amateurs learned a riding technique with a wearable system that automatically provided tactile instructions during descents. These instructions were in sync with the movements of the snowboard and signaled how to move the body. We found that tactile instructions could help snowboarders to improve their skills. We report insights into the snowboarders' opinion and give recommendations for teaching sport skills with tactile instructions.

The widely-used PESQ (Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality) falls short of modeling super-wideband calls, which are characteristics of SILK Skype's codec made public in 2011. Towards a robust QoE (Quality of Experience) metric for VoIP call analysis, we propose a model, referred to as WF-Regression model, to capture the call rate and perceptual quality relationship. The model is shown through a user study that it is robust, R-square = 0.9990 and outperform PESQ modeling the quality of Skype calls, error ratio = 3.68% vs. 14.59%.},

abstract = {To empirically investigate conceptual modeling languages, subjects are typically confronted with experimental tasks, such as the creation, modification or understanding of conceptual models. Thereby, accuracy, i.e., the amount of correctly performed tasks divided by the number of total tasks, is usually used to assess performance. Even though accuracy is widely adopted, it is connected to two often overlooked problems. First, accuracy is a rather insensitive measure. Second, for tasks of low complexity, the measurement of accuracy may be distorted by peculiarities of the human mind. In order to tackle these problems, we propose to additionally assess the subject's mental effort, i.e., the mental resources required to perform a task. In particular, we show how aforementioned problems connected to accuracy can be resolved, that mental effort is a valid measure of performance and how mental effort can easily be assessed in empirical research.},

abstract = {In South Africa, there is a lack of structure or guidance for schools on how to deal with cyber threats. There are no clear procedures that are consistently followed by schools, governing boards and educators, and the cyber threat process is not widely known and understood by educators, learners and their parents/guardians. As a result, many learners remain vulnerable to the negative effects of cyber threats. An example is a Krugersdorp High School girl who was attacked after a cyber-threat ordeal, (The Star 9 February 2012: 1). In this paper a framework is therefore proposed that schools can implement to assist learners with cyber threat incidents.The methodology that will be followed in this article is, firstly, to determine from the literature how a victim of cyber threat can be helped, secondly, to develop an incident handling structure that will assist learners in reporting cyber threats, and thirdly, to develop a framework which will address the lack of structure, guidance or procedures when dealing with cyber threats in schools.The gap which exists now deters learners from reporting cyber threat incidents. To fill this gap, the authors propose an incident handling structure which will assist learners to report and receive protection against online threats. It is hoped that, in the end, learners will know what to do when they are threatened online. In addition, cyber threat policies and procedures are proposed to protect and inform learners and their parents about cyber threats. These procedures collate, outline legislation and the policies of the Department of Basic Education. The aim is to give schools rights and responsibilities in addressing cyber threat incidents.Practical considerations such as time and costs limit the study to a sample of schools in South Africa. The framework for intervention in cyber threat incidents as part of school policies in South Africa is merely a proposal to the rightful stake holders, since policies for schools are determined by the Department of Basic Education which the authors are not members of.},

abstract = {First appearing in the 1930s, skateboarding is an extreme sport in which a skater rides and performs tricks on a skateboard. Nokia Corp. aimed to augment the skateboarding experience with elements taken from modern video games, by coupling a movement measuring skateboard with a Nokia N8 smartphone. Their original implementation, while functional, had limited capabilities and suffered from a number of reliability issues. This project aimed to augment the skateboarding experience further by including location-awareness and skateboard trick visualisation capabilities into the application. A number of steps were also taken in order to improve the robustness of the skateboard hardware, these included modifications to the charging circuit, power source, and addressing the sensor board's vibration susceptibility. A user study was then performed in order to determine what effect the modifications had on the usefulness of the system, focusing on the system's potential as a skateboard trick learning tool. The study showed that, even though users found the visualisation interesting, the system offered limited value as a training device due to the current restrictions which exist in its visualisation capabilities.},

abstract = {The mining industry is constantly faced with the dual needs for safety and improved productivity. It is widely recognized that robots can play a significant role in pre-disaster (pre-emption) and post-disaster (recovery) mine rescue operations. This would inevitably enhance productivity and greatly reduce human exposure to dangerous underground mine environment. Nonetheless, the success of a robot in a mine depends greatly on its visual capability to correctly interpret its immediate environment for navigational purposes. This work serves to assist robots' drivability in an underground mine. A probabilistic approach based on the local entropy is employed. The entropy is measured within a fixed window on a stream of mine frames to compute features used in the segmentation process. We then compare results using the statistical region merging (SRM) approach and evaluate the performance to provide useful qualitative and quantitative conclusions. Different regions of the mine, such as the shaft, stope and gallery, are investigated and results show that a good drivable region can be detected in an underground mine environment.},

However, to increase the workers' awareness about the structure of their work and to help them with the execution of their work processes, a suitable visualization is necessary. Up to now, interaction histories have typically been visualized with the classical Gantt, bar or line charts, neglecting the information contained in links between the individual items in an interaction history. Moreover, clear and empirically grounded guidance for the choice of the visualization is currently lacking. We present two graph-based visualizations for interaction histories and evaluate them against the classical visualizations in a controlled experiment. From the results, we derive a set of recommendations for the visualizations best suited for the different tasks within information workers' work processes.},

abstract = {There are different application domains that would benefit from an approach able to automatically identify emotions in texts. In this paper we propose an approach able to improve existing systems with the ability of identifying levels of emotions in user texts. The improvement can arise either from the additional knowledge about the user interacting with the system (augmenting the user model), or from supporting the evaluation or selection of the text to be delivered by or through the system. The approach is validated through the analysis of well-known literary works, as well as semi-formal texts. Context of application, conclusions and future works are also discussed.},

abstract = {With the fast evolution in the development of applications for mobile devices, the study and adequacy of usability evaluation methodologies in this context is becoming an increasingly demand. Current techniques and equipment particularly adapted to these types of interfaces, such as specific eyetracking equipment for mobile devices, are trying to offer a solution to contexts related to mobility. However, due to known physical restrictions, especially the limited size of displays, data registered by this kind of equipment is limited to qualitative data. These restrictions are especially strong when collecting data from eyetracking techniques. Further study is needed to assess usability in mobile interfaces quickly and comprehensively.This paper shows a state of the art review on the mobile usability evaluation field, specifically focused on the application of eyetracking techniques in usability testing for mobile interfaces. Once related handicaps and awkwardness's are identified, an agile method for exploiting desktop eyetracker equipment in combination with mobile devices is proposed. The point is coming into play the same facilities used in traditional usability testing in order to obtain qualitative and quantitative data.An experimental study of the proposed method has been carried out for two purposes. The first one is to prove the efficiency and applicability of the method, in comparison to existing options. The second one is to deeply analyse quantitative data extracted from the experiment related not only to the gaze, but also to the visual cognition issue in the exploration of the interface. Initial findings from this study are presented.},

abstract = {This article proposes a runtime model that relates server energy consumption to its overall thermal envelope, using hardware performance counters and experimental measurements. While previous studies have attempted system-wide modeling of server power consumption through subsystem models, our approach is different in that it links system energy input to subsystem energy consumption based on a small set of tightly correlated parameters. The proposed model takes into account processor power, bus activities, and system ambient temperature for real-time prediction on the power consumption of long running jobs. Using the HyperTransport and QuickPath Link structures as case studies and through electrical measurements on example server subsystems, we develop a chaotic time-series approximation for runtime power consumption, arriving at the Chaotic Attractor Predictor (CAP). With polynomial time complexity, CAP exhibits high prediction accuracy, having the prediction errors within 1.6% (or 3.3%) for servers based on the HyperTransport bus (or the QuickPath Links), as verified by a set of common processor benchmarks. Our CAP is a superior predictive mechanism over existing linear auto-regressive methods, which require expensive and complex corrective steps to address the nonlinear and chaotic aspects of the underlying physical system.},

abstract = {Detecting Electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities is the process of identifying irregular cardiac activities which may lead to severe heart damage or even sudden death. Due to the rapid development of cyberphysic systems and health informatics, embedding the function of ECG abnormality detection to various devices for real time monitoring has attracted more and more interest in the past few years. The existing machine learning and pattern recognition techniques developed for this purpose usually require sufficient labeled training data for each user. However, obtaining such supervised information is difficult, which makes the proposed ECG monitoring function unrealistic.To tackle the problem, we take advantage of existing well labeled ECG signals and propose a transductive transfer learning framework for the detection of abnormalities in ECG. In our model, unsupervised signals from target users are classified with knowledge transferred from the supervised source signals. In the experimental evaluation, we implemented our method on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmias Dataset and compared it with both anomaly detection and transductive learning baseline approaches. Extensive experiments show that our proposed algorithm remarkably outperforms all the compared methods, proving the effectiveness of it in detecting ECG abnormalities.},

The thirteen items presented in the manifesto however, resulted from several user studies including non-technical users, and highlight aspects that should be taken into account in order to open up internet-of-things creation to a wider audience. To reach out and involve more people in internet-of-things creation, a relation is made to the social phenomenon of do-it-yourself, which provides valuable insights into how society can be encouraged to get involved in creation activities. Most importantly, the manifesto aims at providing a framework for do-it-yourself systems enabling non-technical users to create internet-of-things applications.},

Physiotherapy, including prescribed exercises performed independently by patients in their homes, is a key treatment for many sufferers. However, many patients fail to complete home exercises, prolonging recovery periods or accelerating decline. Pervasive health technologies, capable of monitoring users in their homes, are ideally suited to address this problem. This paper describes user research with a group of three physiotherapists and eleven current physiotherapy patients to understand the problems and user needs underlying non-compliance with home exercise regimes. The research adopted a speed dating approach and culminated with six insights and design recommendations relating to the form and type of feedback that should be used in such systems, to how scheduling and therapist-patient communication systems should be designed and to the role of privacy.},

In this paper, we propose Visualize Your Spatial Experience (VYSE), a method for studying spatial experiences. VYSE leans on visual methods such as coloring and drawing on a map by the users of the space. In addition, interviews are used to elicit details of the user experiences. VYSE was tested in a study of spatial and navigation experiences of exhibition center visitors (N = 14). With the method, it was possible to capture variations in the visitors' experiences systematically in relation to the different locations of the target environment. The results showed that exhibits and physical properties of the space were the two most prominent factors affecting the exhibition experiences.},

abstract = {In Internet architectures, data systems are typically categorized into source-of-truth systems that serve as primary stores for the user-generated writes, and derived data stores or indexes which serve reads and other complex queries. The data in these secondary stores is often derived from the primary data through custom transformations, sometimes involving complex processing driven by business logic. Similarly data in caching tiers is derived from reads against the primary data store, but needs to get invalidated or refreshed when the primary data gets mutated. A fundamental requirement emerging from these kinds of data architectures is the need to reliably capture, flow and process primary data changes.We have built Databus, a source-agnostic distributed change data capture system, which is an integral part of LinkedIn's data processing pipeline. The Databus transport layer provides latencies in the low milliseconds and handles throughput of thousands of events per second per server while supporting infinite look back capabilities and rich subscription functionality. This paper covers the design, implementation and trade-offs underpinning the latest generation of Databus technology. We also present experimental results from stress-testing the system and describe our experience supporting a wide range of LinkedIn production applications built on top of Databus.},

A system learns a model for each user, based on metadata (e.g., content types and contacts) and click histories for old feed items, predicts the click probability for incoming items, and automatically filters out less important ones. In this study, we implemented several alternative automatic filtering systems and evaluate their offline accuracy and user acceptance. 40 users completed the evaluation in a field study. Two main findings emerge from the study. Firstly, PageRank and Bayesian predictors are valid methods; an ensemble predictor combining the two further improves the prediction accuracy. Secondly, people show high acceptance of the automatic filtering function. The participants using the filtering function found it easier to access interesting content than did the participants without the filtering. On average, they also felt greater sense of control, due to the reduced feed volume.},

abstract = {Play with Fire (PWF) is an interactive installation challenging its participants to ignite generative fires over live streaming video of forests. The installation is designed to raise awareness towards sustainability issues such as climate change and forest fires. PWF initially presents its audience with a mashup of forest fire news, followed by playful interaction with fire and forests through a gestural interface. Finally, it connects to its audience mobile phones granting access to a user specific web application depicting the forest they burnt, regenerating in real-time. The forest will take from some months to years to revolve to its original state, depending on the user's performance. In this paper we address the problem of evaluating whether environmental awareness can be achieved through such a controversial installation, and approach the challenges and benefits of using HCI techniques in Digital Arts. Furthermore, we describe the evaluation of PWF in four different contexts and present preliminary results.},

abstract = {If people are not in control of the collection and sharing of their personal health information collected using mobile health (mHealth) devices and applications, privacy concerns could limit their willingness to use and reduce potential benefits provided via mHealth. We investigated users' willingness to share their personal information, collected using mHealth sensing devices, with their family, friends, third parties, and the public. Previous work employed hypothetical scenarios, surveys and interviews to understand people's information-sharing behavior; to the best of our knowledge, ours is the first privacy study where participants actually have the option to share their own information with real people. We expect our results can guide the development of privacy controls for mobile devices and applications that collect any personal and activity information, not restricted to health or fitness information.Our study revealed three interesting findings about people's privacy concerns regarding their sensed health information: 1) We found that people share certain health information less with friends and family than with strangers, but more with specific third parties than the public. 2) Information that people were less willing to share could be information that is indirectly collected by the mobile devices. 3) We confirmed that privacy concerns are not static; mHealth device users may change their sharing decisions over time. Based on our findings, we emphasize the need for sensible default settings and flexible privacy controls to allow people to choose different settings for different recipients, and to change their sharing settings at any time.},

We provide a security analysis of its four default distortion profiles as well as a usability analysis that shows how these profiles affect response time and accurate understanding. Our results illustrate the security/usability tradeoffs that arise in the face of adversaries that use current, off-the-shelf optical character recognition technology in order to launch a variety of attacks. Two profiles, in particular, achieve a level of protection that seems to justify their respective usability degradation in many situations. The 'strongest' distortion profile, however, does not seem to provide a large additional security margin against the adversaries we considered.},

abstract = {Tor is a low-latency anonymity-preserving network that enables its users to protect their privacy online. It consists of volunteer-operated routers from all around the world that serve hundreds of thousands of users every day. Due to congestion and a low relay-to-client ratio, Tor suffers from performance issues that can potentially discourage its wider adoption, and result in an overall weaker anonymity to all users.We seek to improve the performance of Tor by defining different classes of service for its traffic. We recognize that although the majority of Tor traffic is interactive web browsing, a relatively small amount of bulk downloading consumes an unfair amount of Tor's scarce bandwidth. Furthermore, these traffic classes have different time and bandwidth constraints; therefore, they should not be given the same Quality of Service (QoS), which Tor offers them today.We propose and evaluate DiffTor, a machine-learning-based approach that classifies Tor's encrypted circuits by application in real time and subsequently assigns distinct classes of service to each application. Our experiments confirm that we are able to classify circuits we generated on the live Tor network with an extremely high accuracy that exceeds 95%. We show that our real-time classification in combination with QoS can considerably improve the experience of Tor clients, as our simple techniques result in a 75% improvement in responsiveness and an 86% reduction in download times at the median for interactive users.},

abstract = {PlayAllAround is a wearable camera-pico-projector system where the scalable interface allows mobile interaction. We access the digital information from the projected scalable interface, which provides both the nearer small-size interface and the farther large-size interface supporting private and public use. The system is in charge of realizing our concepts of an environment independent interface (EII), which focuses on enabling people to access their personal data as well as public resources at any time and any place. In this paper, we propose the design of a reference-cell in the field of ergonomics as well as the principle from decomposition of the application tasks to allow a scalable interface design, with the aim of providing enhanced user experience. We also present the design and the implementation aspects of our PlayAllAround system. We finally describe the evaluation methods and results of the hover gesture and the scalable interface from both the qualitative and quantitative points of view.},

abstract = {Internet censorship by governments is an increasingly common practice worldwide. Internet users and censors are locked in an arms race: as users find ways to evade censorship schemes, the censors develop countermeasures for the evasion tactics. One of the most popular and effective circumvention tools, Tor, must regularly adjust its network traffic signature to remain usable.We present StegoTorus, a tool that comprehensively disguises Tor from protocol analysis. To foil analysis of packet contents, Tor's traffic is steganographed to resemble an innocuous cover protocol, such as HTTP. To foil analysis at the transport level, the Tor circuit is distributed over many shorter-lived connections with per-packet characteristics that mimic cover-protocol traffic. Our evaluation demonstrates that StegoTorus improves the resilience of Tor to fingerprinting attacks and delivers usable performance.},

This attack is the first such attack demonstrated on a symmetric multiprocessing system virtualized using a modern VMM (Xen). Such systems are very common today, ranging from desktops that use virtualization to sandbox application or OS compromises, to clouds that co-locate the workloads of mutually distrustful customers. Constructing such a side-channel requires overcoming challenges including core migration, numerous sources of channel noise, and the difficulty of preempting the victim with sufficient frequency to extract fine-grained information from it. This paper addresses these challenges and demonstrates the attack in a lab setting by extracting an ElGamal decryption key from a victim using the most recent version of the libgcrypt cryptographic library.},

abstract = {Driving a modern vehicle is a complex, cognitive demanding task involving concentrated observation of the road, roadside, car status, information displays of assistance systems, etc. Drivers are conscious about this overabundance of information, nevertheless, they are operating tertiary controls, talking on the phone, smoking cigarettes, having lunch, reading maps or meeting agendas, or working on their computer. As a consequence -- caused by visual/manual/cognitive demand and limited multitasking capabilities-- precarious driving situations are created. Solutions are rare but badly needed to prevent imminent danger on the roads. To explore the potential of thermal imaging to infer mental conditions of the driver in an unobtrusive manner, and to use this information to automatically react to a detected risky state, we have developed the "FaceLight" prototype and performed a lab-based driving simulator study to evaluate the interface under conditions of varying workload. With "FaceLight" the driver can be interpreted as sort of signal light, with a 'red face' (hot surface temperature) standing for high stress or cognitive demand while a 'green face' (cooler temperature) equals to a more relaxed, stress-free mental state. Initial results have revealed that this technology has potential to capture shifts in the mental state of an individual in an inattentive manner, but highlighted also that a lot of influencing factors still need to be incorporated to reliably recognize a specific state solely based on facial skin temperature.},

What motivates the description as patterns is the generalization of similar methods, the reasoning for the actual form in terms of forces, and the contextualization and connection of the methods/tools. Very often a specific method implies other methods to follow up or it can be combined with other methods. A pattern language captures such relations.},

abstract = {For years the development of software artifacts was the sole domain of developers and project managers. However, experience has taught us that the users play a very important role in software development and construction. The inclusion of the Domain Experts directly in the development cycle is a very important characteristic of Domain-Specific Languages, as they have often an important role in making and constraining the domain of the language.DSLs are credited with increased productivity and ease of use, but this fact is hardly ever proven. Moreover, Usability tests are frequently only performed at the final stages of the project when changes have a significant impact on the budget. To help prevent this, in this paper we present a pattern language for evaluating the usability of DSLs. These patterns can help show how to use an iterative usability validation development strategy to produce DSLs that can achieve a high degree of Usability.},

Our analysis reveals programming language adoption phenomena surrounding developer age, birth year, workplace, and software repository preference.We find that survey methods are increasingly accessible and relevant, but there are distinctive problems in examining developers and code repositories. We show that analyzing software repositories suffers from sample bias problems similar to those encountered when directly polling developers. Such bias limits the general validity of research claims based on analysis of software repositories. We aid future empirical researchers by describing concrete practices and opportunities to improve the results of developer and software repository surveys.},

abstract = {Computer-mediated textual communication has become ubiquitous in recent years. Compared to face-to-face interactions, there is decreased bandwidth in affective information, yet studies show that interactions in this medium still produce rich and fulfilling affective outcomes. While overt communication (e.g., emoticons or explicit discussion of emotion) can explain some aspects of affect conveyed through textual dialogue, there may also be an underlying implicit affective channel through which participants perceive additional emotional information. To investigate this phenomenon, computer-mediated tutoring sessions were recorded with Kinect video and depth images and processed with novel tracking techniques for posture and hand-to-face gestures. Analyses demonstrated that tutors implicitly perceived students' focused attention, physical demand, and frustration. Additionally, bodily expressions of posture and gesture correlated with student cognitive-affective states that were perceived by tutors through the implicit affective channel. Finally, posture and gesture complement each other in multimodal predictive models of student cognitive-affective states, explaining greater variance than either modality alone. This approach of empirically studying the implicit affective channel may identify details of human behavior that can inform the design of future textual dialogue systems modeled on naturalistic interaction.},

In this paper, we present a method based on concatenated Hidden Markov Model (co-HMM) to infer the dimensional and continuous emotion labels from audio-visual cues. Our method is based on the assumption that continuous emotion levels can be modeled by a set of discrete values. Based on this, we represent each emotional dimension by step-wise label classes, and learn the intrinsic and extrinsic dynamics using our co-HMM model. We evaluate our approach on the Audio-Visual Emotion Challenge (AVEC 2012) dataset. Our results show considerable improvement over the baseline regression model presented with the AVEC 2012.},

This paper presents a user study examining the limitations and affordances of novel game controllers in an interactive TV (iTV) context and compares them to "second display" approaches using tablets. We look at task completion times, accuracy and user satisfaction across a number of tasks and find that the Wiimote is most liked and performed best in almost all tasks.

The methods described are easy to implement, but it is essential to apply them in the right way. This paper provides an overview of the different techniques, showing where to apply them and comparing the effects. Detection accuracy is important, but there are trade-offs to consider.

A key aspect of natural interaction is the ability to understand and appropriately respond to human emotions. This paper details our response to the Audio/Visual Emotion Challenge (AVEC'12) whose goal is to continuously predict four affective signals describing human emotions (namely valence, arousal, expectancy and power). The proposed method uses log-magnitude Fourier spectra to extract multiscale dynamic descriptions of signals characterizing global and local face appearance as well as head movements and voice. We perform a kernel regression with very few representative samples selected via a supervised weighted-distance-based clustering, that leads to a high generalization power. For selecting features, we introduce a new correlation-based measure that takes into account a possible delay between the labels and the data and significantly increases robustness. We also propose a particularly fast regressor-level fusion framework to merge systems based on different modalities. Experiments have proven the efficiency of each key point of the proposed method and we obtain very promising results.},

abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a novel interaction model for reading text documents depending on situated touch. This interaction modality targets Individuals with Blindness or Severe Visual Impairment (IBSVI). We aim to provide IBSVI with an effective reading tool that enables them to use their spatial abilities while reading. We used an iPad device and augmented it with a static tactile overlay to display the text to serve as a kind of spatial landmark space for the IBSVI. The text is rendered audibly in response to user's touch. Two user studies, with IBSVI participants, were conducted to test the system. The first study was a laboratory-controlled study, and the second one was a longitudinal study. These studies showed that while the approach is new to the users' experience, it is a promising direction to enable self-paced spatial reading for IBSVI.},

abstract = {A plethora of technologies is adopted in modern continuous care settings. Nowadays, the nurse is responsible for orchestrating all these devices to take advantage of the collected information. This causes caregivers to lose time, miss out on patient insights and lack a general overview of the situation. In this paper, an ontology-based and self-learning context-aware platform is presented. This platform combines pervasive and context-aware techniques with knowledge management techniques to leverage the aforementioned problems and allows to easily build intelligent applications to support caregivers in their everyday activities. Moreover, a self-learning framework is proposed, which allows detecting trends in the usage of these applications and adapting them accordingly. However, the integration of context-aware technologies can prove to be difficult if domain experts are not involved in the development process. This increases the fear of the technology, makes the staff feel less in control and empowered and causes that the technologies are not tuned towards the work processes of the staff. Therefore, a participatory ontology engineering methodology is also presented which allows involving the stakeholders in each part of the development process of context-aware applications.},

abstract = {This paper describes the transformation of a city government led by a 311 program, which provides a consolidated channel for non-emergency services and information. The paper first discusses the concept of "smart city" as a foundation for the examination of the 311 program as a practice of government innovation. The paper then presents the details of the 311 program as instantiated in the City of Philadelphia. In-depth interviews with Philadelphia City government officials and managers responsible for creating and operating the City's 311 system (Philly311) offer insights into the contributions the system is making to a more efficient, effective, transparent, accountable, and collaborative city government. Performance data provided by Philly311 enables more efficient resource allocation and informed decision making. Philly311 is credited with making the process of service delivery more transparent to the public, and providing traceability of requested services which imbues service departments with a sense of accountability. Service level agreements are providing measurable standards of municipal services and are used to support accountability in terms of service status. Regular reviews of service level agreements and content of the system are also recognized as promoting interdepartmental collaboration. 311 systems are broadly recognized as powerful tools to engage residents in improving their neighborhoods. Institutionalizing interdepartmental collaborations emerged from the interviews as a critical capability in advancing from the initiation stage of Philly311-like systems to operations and refinement.},

Our main assumption is that users are able to spatially localize what they want to photograph, and roughly aim the camera in the appropriate direction. Thus, small camera motions are sufficient for obtaining a good composition. Results in the context of documenting accessibility barriers related to public transportation show that audio feedback is valuable. Visually impaired users were not affected by audio feedback in terms of social comfort. Furthermore, we observed trends in favor of speech over tone, including higher ratings for ease of use. This study reinforces earlier work that suggests users who are blind or low vision find assisted photography appealing and useful.},

Data collected from semi-structured interviews with key participants and a variety of secondary data that were analyzed with an inductive approach to identify and address the impact of the influential factors on attaining the stated goals of the collaboration. The study extends the current knowledge-base regarding TPSKNs into a new transnational context, and a new policy domain, public health. It expands upon the considered contexts to include technological context, central when exchange centers on implementing a new system or adopting an existing system. The study also expands understanding of the influential factors deriving from knowledge and information; organizational; and national layers of context.},

abstract = {Accurate estimation of Energy Expenditure (EE) in ambulatory settings is a key element in determining the causal relation between aspects of human behavior related to physical activity and health. We present a new methodology for activity-specific EE algorithms. The proposed methodology models activity clusters using specific parameters that capture differences in EE within a cluster, and combines these models with Metabolic Equivalents (METs) derived from the compendium of physical activities. We designed a protocol consisting of a wide set of sedentary, household, lifestyle and gym activities, and developed a new activity-specific EE algorithm applying the proposed methodology. The algorithm uses accelerometer (ACC) and heart rate (HR) data acquired by a single monitoring device, together with anthropometric variables, to predict EE. Our model recognizes six clusters of activities independent of the subject in 52.6 hours of recordings from 19 participants. Increases in EE estimation accuracy ranged from 18 to 31% compared to state of the art single and multi-sensor activity-specific methods.},

abstract = {Water is one of the basic requirements of any community, without water supply, human life is not possible. The next most essential requirement is the elimination of waste matters from the water. Anaerobic wastewater treatment differs from traditional aerobic treatment in that no aeration is used. In this paper, cheese-dairy wastewater is taken for the treatment. The ultimate objective of wastewater treatment is the conservation of good, quality water, the most priceless resource. Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) is an essential test for determining the quality of effluents and wastewaters prior to discharge. COD test predicts the level of oxygen requirement of the effluent and is exploited for monitoring and control of discharges and for assessing treatment plant performance. The entire process in an anaerobic wastewater treatment system for the prediction of COD includes, data collection and pre-processing (Statistical Normalization technique), Feature Selection and Prediction of COD using Back Propagation Neural Network (BPN). During the pre-processing phase several normalization techniques are used. The major objective of this paper is to propose several statistical normalization techniques and to improve the prediction accuracy. BPN is found to be best for the prediction of COD. In order to find the effect of normalization technique in the prediction of COD, experiments were carried out to find the prediction of accuracy of BPN before/after normalization techniques.},

This paper explores the use of interactive textile interfaces to enable embodied interactions with a robot companion of play. More in detail, we investigate the possibility of achieving by design a shared perception with the robot, with the objective to stimulate reflection during play, development of play styles and learning of social competences. A research-through-design approach is used to investigate the emergence of social behaviors during play, by sparking embodied interaction between child and robot. Two prototypes embedding interactive textile modules have been developed: S-Bristle (sensible bristle), a pressure sensitive fabric module that enables sensory-stimulation games, and Interactive Fur an interactive soft woolen cover that sustains perceptual-motor coordination and symbolic games. Both modules have been developed using a phenomenology inspired design approach to embodied interaction, which focuses on perception and bodily experience as means to foster social skills.},

During the long period in front of the computer, bad postures and habits will result in some health risks, and the unawareness of fatigue will impair the work efficiency. We investigate how users behave in front of the computer with a camera. Face pose, eye gaze, eye blinking, and yawn frequency are considered. These visual cues are then used to give suggestions to users for correcting wrong posture and indicating the need for a break. We propose a novel framework of personal assistant for a user when he uses computer for a long time. The camera produces the video stream which records the user behavior. The automatically assistant system will analyze the visual inputs and give suggestions at the right time. Our experiment shows that it achieves high accuracy of detecting visual cues, and makes reasonable suggestions to users.

It turned out that the shortness of a voice command -- in terms of number of words -- is more important than it being absolutely natural. Participants preferred the voice command with the fewest words and the fewest syllables. For the voice commands which had the same number of syllables, the users also preferred the one with the fewest words, even though there were no big differences in time and errors.},

Typically, demonstrating such claims about social interaction would be approached through the lens of sentiment analysis. In this work, we argue instead for a multifaceted view of emotional state, which incorporates both a static view of emotion (sentiment) with a dynamic view based on the behaviors present in a text. We codify this dynamic view through data annotations marking information sharing, sentiment, and coping efficacy. Through machine learning analysis of these annotations, we demonstrate that while sentiment predicts a user's stress at the beginning of a chat, dynamic views of efficacy are stronger indicators of stress reduction.},
