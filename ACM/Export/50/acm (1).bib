abstract = {Moving human-computer interaction off the desktop and into our cities requires new approaches to understanding people and technologies in the built environment. We approach the city as a system, with human, physical and digital components and behaviours. In creating effective and usable urban pervasive computing systems, we need to take into account the patterns of movement and encounter amongst people, locations, and mobile and fixed devices in the city. Advances in mobile and wireless communications have enabled us to detect and record the presence and movement of devices through cities. This article makes a number of methodological and empirical contributions. We present a toolkit of algorithms and visualization techniques that we have developed to model and make sense of spatial and temporal patterns of mobility, presence, and encounter. Applying this toolkit, we provide an analysis of urban Bluetooth data based on a longitudinal dataset containing millions of records associated with more than 70000 unique devices in the city of Bath, UK. Through a novel application of established complex network analysis techniques, we demonstrate a significant finding on the relationship between temporal factors and network structure. Finally, we suggest how our understanding and exploitation of these data may begin to inform the design and use of urban pervasive systems.},

abstract = {Many tasks require attention switching. For example, searching for information on one sheet of paper and then entering this information onto another one. With paper we see that people use fingers or objects as placeholders. Using these simple aids, the process of switching attention between displays can be simplified and speeded up. With large or multiple visual displays we have many tasks where both attention areas are on the screen and where using a finger as a placeholder is not suitable. One way users deal with this is to use the mouse and highlight their current focus. However, this also has its limitations -- in particular in environments where there is no pointing device. Our approach is to utilize the user's gaze position to provide a visual placeholder. The last area where a user fixated on the screen (before moving their attention away) is highlighted; we call this visual reminder a Gazemark. Gazemarks ease orientation and the resumption of the interrupted task when coming back to this display. In this paper we report on a study where the effectiveness of using Gazemarks was investigated, in particular we show how they can ease attention switching. Our results show faster completion times for a resumed simple visual search task when using this technique. The paper analyzes relevant parameters for the implementation of Gazemarks and discusses some further application areas for this approach.},

However, this information is not typically accessible to patients, who are frequently under-informed and unclear about their own hospital courses. In this paper, we propose a design for in-room, patient-centric information displays, based on iterative design with physicians. We use this as the basis for a Wizard-of-Oz study in an emergency department, to assess patient and provider responses to in-room information displays. 18 patients were presented with real-time information displays based on their medical records. Semi-structured interviews with patients, family members, and hospital staff reveal that subjective response to in-room displays was overwhelmingly positive, and through these interviews we elicited guidelines regarding specific information types, privacy, use cases, and information presentation techniques. We describe these findings, and we discuss the feasibility of a fully-automatic implementation of our design.},

abstract = {As America's baby boom population gets older, aging in place -- the idea that seniors can remain independent in a comfortable home environment while being monitored and receiving care from family and caregivers living elsewhere -- has received significant attention. Fostering a sense of independence while simultaneously enabling monitoring and frequent interaction can seem paradoxical, however. This raises questions of how we can design technologies that help seniors retain their independence and a sense of comfort, while still interacting with and being monitored regularly by others. We present results from an interview study of 30 seniors, caregivers and relatives in which we sought to understand how they managed their interactions, availability, privacy and independence. Results suggest that they rely on attributes of the physical environment, temporal structures such as routine conversations and activities, and technological mediation.},

Armed with survey data indicating that active sharers of novel web content are often those that actively seek it out, we developed FeedMe, a plug-in for Google Reader that makes directed sharing of content a more salient part of the user experience. FeedMe recommends friends who may be interested in seeing content that the user is viewing, provides information on what the recipient has seen and how many emails they have received recently, and gives recipients the opportunity to provide lightweight feedback when they appreciate shared content. FeedMe introduces a novel design space within mixed-initiative social recommenders: friends who know the user voluntarily vet the material on the user's behalf. We performed a two-week field experiment (N=60) and found that FeedMe made it easier and more enjoyable to share content that recipients appreciated and would not have found otherwise.},

This paper explores two different "behind-the-scenes" roles for human operators during a three-month gallery installation of an embodied character experience. In the Transcription role, human operators type players' spoken utterances; then, algorithms interpret the player's intention, choose from pre-authored dialogue based on local and global narrative contexts, and procedurally animate two embodied characters. In the Discourse role, human operators select from semantic categories to interpret player intention; algorithms use this "discourse act" to automate character dialogue and animation. We compare these two methods of blending control using game logs and interviews, and document how the amateur operators initially resisted having to learn the Discourse version, but eventually preferred having the authorial control it afforded. This paper also outlines a design space for blending machine and human control in live character experiences.},

We explore this question via ReBoard, a system that automatically captures whiteboard images and makes them accessible through a novel set of user-centered access tools. Through the lens of a seven week workplace field study, we found that by enabling new workflows, ReBoard increased the value of whiteboard content for collaboration.},

Our study shows how missing or problematic representations of a patient affect work activities and patient care. We accordingly suggest that EHR systems could be made more usable and useful in the long run, by supporting both representations of medical processes and of patients.},

The test platform can fully support automatic test which will greatly reduce the cost of testing and improve the quality of test. With the introduction of Logic Deduction Agent (LDA), the intelligence and test efficiency of the test platform are considerably increased. What's more, the parallel and distributed framework based on LDA contributes to the high executing efficiency and flexibility of the test platform. On the other hand, the test coverage can be well evaluated with the help of LDA.},

The M&amp;S techniques used for these types of analyses by necessity challenge the traditional boundaries and methods regarding validation efforts. Given that the analysis of populations is largely intractable via reductionist methodologies, we posit that insight must be garnered through experiment and iteration using simulated societies. Further, the designs of these simulation experiments must be based on the information needs of the community.

abstract = {Troubleshooting unresponsive sensor nodes is a significant challenge in remote sensor network deployments. This paper introduces the tele-diagnostic powertracer, an in-situ troubleshooting tool that uses external power measurements to determine the internal health condition of an unresponsive host and the most likely cause of its failure. We developed our own low-cost power meter with low-bandwidth radio to report power measurements and findings, hence allowing remote (i.e., tele-) diagnosis. The tool was deployed and tested in a remote solar-powered sensing network for acoustic and visual environmental monitoring. It was shown to successfully distinguish between several categories of failures that cause unresponsive behavior including energy depletion, antenna damage, radio disconnection, system crashes, and anomalous reboots. It was also able to determine the internal health conditions of an unresponsive node, such as the presence or absence of sensing and data storage activities (for each of multiple sensors). The paper explores the feasibility of building such a remote diagnostic tool from the standpoint of economy, scale and diagnostic accuracy. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first paper that presents a remote diagnostic tool that uses power measurements to diagnose sensor system failures.},

abstract = {Body sensor networks are emerging as a promising platform for remote human monitoring. With the aim of extracting bio-kinematic parameters from distributed body-worn sensors, these systems require collaboration of sensor nodes to obtain relevant information from an overwhelmingly large volume of data. Clearly, efficient data reduction techniques and distributed signal processing algorithms are needed. In this paper, we present a data processing technique that constructs motion transcripts from inertial sensors and identifies human movements by taking collaboration between the nodes into consideration. Transcripts of basic motions, called primitives, are built to reduce the complexity of the sensor data. This model leads to a distributed algorithm for segmentation and action recognition. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework using data collected from five normal subjects performing ten transitional movements. The results clearly illustrate the effectiveness of our framework. In particular, we obtain a classification accuracy of 84.13% with only one sensor node involved in the classification process.},

abstract = {As energy-related costs have become a major economical factor for IT infrastructures and data-centers, companies and the research community are being challenged to find better and more efficient power-aware resource management strategies. There is a growing interest in "Green" IT and there is still a big gap in this area to be covered.In order to obtain an energy-efficient data center, we propose a framework that provides an intelligent consolidation methodology using different techniques such as turning on/off machines, power-aware consolidation algorithms, and machine learning techniques to deal with uncertain information while maximizing performance. For the machine learning approach, we use models learned from previous system behaviors in order to predict power consumption levels, CPU loads, and SLA timings, and improve scheduling decisions. Our framework is vertical, because it considers from watt consumption to workload features, and cross-disciplinary, as it uses a wide variety of techniques.We evaluate these techniques with a framework that covers the whole control cycle of a real scenario, using a simulation with representative heterogeneous workloads, and we measure the quality of the results according to a set of metrics focused toward our goals, besides traditional policies. The results obtained indicate that our approach is close to the optimal placement and behaves better when the level of uncertainty increases.},

abstract = {Contemporary datacenters comprise hundreds or thousands of machines running applications requiring high availability and responsiveness. Although a performance crisis is easily detected by monitoring key end-to-end performance indicators (KPIs) such as response latency or request throughput, the variety of conditions that can lead to KPI degradation makes it difficult to select appropriate recovery actions. We propose and evaluate a methodology for automatic classification and identification of crises, and in particular for detecting whether a given crisis has been seen before, so that a known solution may be immediately applied. Our approach is based on a new and efficient representation of the datacenter's state called a fingerprint, constructed by statistical selection and summarization of the hundreds of performance metrics typically collected on such systems. Our evaluation uses 4 months of trouble-ticket data from a production datacenter with hundreds of machines running a 24x7 enterprise-class user-facing application. In experiments in a realistic and rigorous operational setting, our approach provides operators the information necessary to initiate recovery actions with 80% correctness in an average of 10 minutes, which is 50 minutes earlier than the deadline provided to us by the operators. To the best of our knowledge this is the first rigorous evaluation of any such approach on a large-scale production installation.},

Such a vision relies on integration of multiple subfields of computer science, and a commitment to an understanding of the domain of application. It supports the hopes of a grid/cyberinfrastructure-enabled future that makes use of social software. However, in contrast to how emergency management is often understood, it aims to push beyond the idea of monitoring on-line activity, and instead focuses on an understudied but critical aspect of mass emergency response---the needs and roles of members of the public. By viewing the citizenry as a powerful, self-organizing, and collectively intelligent force, information and communication technology can play a transformational role in crisis. Critical topics for research and development include an understanding of the quantity and quality of information (and its continuous change) produced through computer-mediated communication during emergencies; mechanisms for ensuring trustworthiness and security of information; mechanisms for aligning informal and formal sources of information; and new applications of information extraction techniques.},

abstract = {Named entity recognition studies the problem of locating and classifying parts of free text into a set of predefined categories. Although extensive research has focused on the detection of person, location and organization entities, there are many other entities of interest, including phone numbers, dates, times and currencies (to name a few examples). We refer to these types of entities as "semi-structured named entities", since they usually follow certain syntactic formats according to some conventions, although their structure is typically not well-defined. Regular expression solutions require significant amount of manual effort and supervised machine learning approaches rely on large sets of labeled training data. Therefore, these approaches do not scale when we need to support many semi-structured entity types in many languages and regions.In this paper, we study this problem and propose a novel three-level bootstrapping framework for the detection of semi-structured entities. We describe the proposed techniques for phone, date and time entities, and perform extensive evaluations on English, German, Polish, Swedish and Turkish documents. Despite the minimal input from the user, our approach can achieve 95% precision and 84% recall for phone entities, and 94% precision and 81% recall for date and time entities, on average. We also discuss implementation details and report run time performance results, which show significant improvements over regular expression based solutions.},

We propose an extension to the one-class evaluation framework in truly one-case cases when only some positive training examples are available. We extent the one-class setting to the co-training principle that enables us to take advantage of multiple views on the data. We report evaluation results of this extension on three different corpora including Enron Corpus.},

abstract = {The World Wide Web (Web) is changing. The much vaunted Web 2.0 sees once static pages evolving into hybrid applications. Content that was once simple is now becoming increasingly complicated due to the many updating components located throughout the page. The information overload and visual complexity of such components is significant. This increased complexity can produce lower performance and higher levels of stress and frustration which negatively effect the user. In previous work we have shown how galvanic skin response (GSR) measurements, collected in tandem with eye-tracking data, can be used as a method for determining how stressed users become when interacting with content. The results of that study demonstrated that when used appropriately, the presence of Web 2.0 content can reduce GSR measurements and be of benefit to users. In this work, the previous study was repeated with twenty-three older Web users to establish if similar patterns of interaction could be established. The results reveal that while older participants made use of dynamic content, unlike previous participants, they were a non-homogenous group with a large variance in the GSR measurements. We assert that a cause of this is hesitancy and therefore developing techniques to reduce hesitancy will benefit older users when interacting with Web 2.0 content.},

abstract = {Online reviews have become increasingly popular as a way to judge the quality of various products and services. However, recent work demonstrates that the absence of reporting incentives leads to a biased set of reviews that may not reflect the true quality. In this paper, we investigate underlying factors that influence users when reporting feedback. In particular, we study both reporting incentives and reporting biases observed in a widely used review forum, the Tripadvisor Web site. We consider three sources of information: first, the numerical ratings left by the user for different aspects of quality; second, the textual comment accompanying a review; third, the patterns in the time sequence of reports. We first show that groups of users who discuss a certain feature at length are more likely to agree in their ratings. Second, we show that users are more motivated to give feedback when they perceive a greater risk involved in a transaction. Third, a user's rating partly reflects the difference between true quality and prior expectation of quality, as inferred from previous reviews. We finally observe that because of these biases, when averaging review scores there are strong differences between the mean and the median. We speculate that the median may be a better way to summarize the ratings.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose the use of surrogate models to avoid or limit violations of the service level agreements (protect SLAs) of enterprise applications executed within virtualized data centers (VDCs).Modern enterprise services are delivered along with service level agreements (SLAs) that formalize the expected quality of service, and define penalties in case of violations. By deploying enterprise applications within VDCs, providers can dynamically change the execution configuration of the services to react to unplanned environmental conditions, like sudden changes in the workload mix and intensity, with the goal of avoiding SLA violations while reducing operational costs with respect to traditional over-provisioning solutions.Surrogate models are successfully used in modern engineering to approximate systems' behavior, and thus support a wide scope of activities, especially design optimization. In this paper, we show that by reducing the problem of protecting SLAs in VDCs to an optimization problem, we can adapt surrogate models to this new framework and implement SLA protection controller components. In the paper, we present the main ideas, we illustrate how surrogate models can be used to protect SLAs, and we discuss preliminary results obtained on a case study deployed in an industrial virtualized infrastructure.},

In some software development organizations, punishment measures have been adopted in an attempt to improve software developers' performance, reduce the software defects, and hence ensure software quality. It is unclear whether these measures are effective. This article presents the results of a multi-method field study that analyzes software engineers' perception towards penalty policies in relation to software quality in a software development process. The results were generated via both qualitative and quantitative methods. Through interviews, we collected the individuals' perception towards the penalty policy. By extracting data in a software configuration management system, we identified several patterns of defects change. We found that while a penalty mechanism does help to reduce software defects in daily coding activity, it fails in achieving programmers' maximum work potential. Meanwhile, experienced software programmers require less time to adapt to penalty policies and benefit from exist of less experienced developers. Some additional findings and implications are also discussed.},

abstract = {It is widely accepted that awareness of architectural decisions enables better management and planning of system evolution, refactoring, and modernization efforts. In this paper we report data from interviews with software architects about how practitioners utilize architecture during system evolution. Our results show, despite the widely shared view that long-lived systems are better off with strong architectures; basic architecture-centric practices are not followed systematically. The key gap we observe is in correct and timely communication of architectural issues. This overall finding is not surprising. However, our data also contributes to how architecture knowledge management activities can be focused for most benefit throughout a system's lifespan. While the often-referenced problem is lack of time spent on documentation and design practices, our interviews show that lack of quality attribute reasoning early on, and during the lifespan of the system is a key contributor to failing to use architecture knowledge effectively during evolution.},

abstract = {Leadership is the ability to influence people, leading them to behave in a certain way in order to achieve the group's goals. Leadership is independent of job titles and descriptions. Usually, however, in order to lead, leaders need the power derived from their organizational positions. There are different leadership styles, like task-oriented versus people-oriented, directive versus permissive, autocrat versus democrat. In this paper, we examine the leadership concept in software development environments and focus on leadership in transition processes to agile software development. Specifically, based on our comprehensive research on agile software development, we suggest a leadership style - ad-hoc leadership - that usually emerges in such change processes. We present the characteristics, dynamic and uniqueness of this leadership style and illustrate its usefulness for the analysis of representative scenarios.},

abstract = {Service-based applications need to operate in a highly dynamic and distributed world. As those applications are composed of individual services, they have to react to failures of those services to ensure that the applications maintain their expected functionality and quality. Self-adaptation is one solution to this problem, as it allows applications to autonomously react to failures. Currently, monitoring is typically used to identify failures, thus triggering adaptation. However, monitoring only observes failures after they have occurred, which means that adaptation based on monitoring is reactive. This can lead to shortcomings like user dissatisfaction, increased execution times, and late response to critical events. Pro-active adaptation addresses those shortcomings, because in such a setting, the application detects the need for adaptation and thus can adapt before a failure will occur. However, it is important to avoid unnecessary pro-active adaptations, as they can lead to severe shortcomings, such as increased costs or follow-up failures. This means that when taking pro-active adaptation decisions it is key that there is confidence in the predicted future failures, i.e., pro-active adaptation should only be performed if there is certainty that the failure could in fact occur. To avoid unnecessary adaptations, we introduce an approach based on augmenting service monitoring with online testing to produce failure predictions with confidence. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach using a scenario from the eGovernment domain.},

However, understanding the game's instructions also affects a novice player's gameplay experience. In the pilot study, reactions of novice players to two commercially available games with exertive interfaces were systematically analyzed so obstacles to communication between players and software could be identified. The social affordances of game design for adults over 40 are also discussed in order to develop protocols for a larger study analyzing how digital games can be used to sustain exercise adherence over time.},

In this paper we discuss some of the challenges of using a null dereference analysis in practice, and reasons why developers may not feel it necessary to change code to prevent ever possible null dereference. We revisit previous work on XYLEM, an interprocedural null dereference analysis for Java, and discuss the challenge of comparing the results of different static analysis tools. We also report experimental results for XYLEM, Coverity Prevent, Fortify SCA, Eclipse and FindBugs, and observe that the different tools tradeoff the need to flag all potential null dereferences with the need to minimize the number of cases that are implausible in practice. We conclude by discussing whether it would be useful to extend the Java type system to distinguish between nullable and nonnull types, and prohibit unchecked dereferences of nullable types.},

abstract = {Instructors modify offerings of their courses in response to changes in emphasis, curriculum, student preparation, resource limitations, and problems with previous offerings. Changes also involve assessment instruments such as assignments and exams, ensuring that students are indeed learning the material, rather than relying on "information" from previous offerings. However, instructors are seldom guided by meaningful and useful data in making these changes. Instead, most rely on their "gut feelings", and many changes are made in an ad hoc manner, with minimal supporting data to assess whether the changes contribute positively or negatively to student learning. This paper reports on our experience with the transformation of an undergraduate database course at the University of British Columbia (UBC), using best practices from education research. We provide examples of the types of data that can be obtained through various instruments, and can be used in an objective analysis to affect course changes. If such data collection methods are put into place before changes to a course are anticipated, instructors will be better prepared to assess how students are affected by those changes.This paper is organized as follows. Sections 1 and 2 provide background information about a process model for course transformation. Section 3 describes the course being studied. Section 4 shows different types of instruments that can be used for data collection. Section 5 provides examples of the data collected, and the analysis that can be performed using that information. Section 6 describes our plans for course transformation based on the data collected.},

abstract = {Most of women's deaths related to pregnancy occur in newly industrialized countries. In association with gynecologists and obstetricians of the Antonio Pedro University Hospital (HUAP) in Brazil, we have identified deficiencies in the prenatal care of the Brazilian public healthcare system that can be computer-supported. They are mainly related to protocols that must be followed in the primary healthcare institutions and the referral process that must take place when a high risk pregnancy is identified, besides other functionalities that can be automated by a software application. In this paper, the Prenatal Care Unified System (SUAP) project will be introduced, which provides a Multi-agent System for supporting and monitoring the prenatal care. This project uses agent technology to manage healthcare records, to act as a clinical decision support system, and to handle the logistics of high risk pregnancy cases. We also describe the challenges encountered during the implementation of the SUAP and discuss the benefits that an agent-based solution provided to the development of our system.},

A recent breakthrough in harmonic analysis is diffusion geometry and diffusion wavelets, which offers a general framework for multiscale analysis of massive data sets. In this paper, we introduce the "diffusion" concept into the MAS field, and investigate the impacts of using diffusion distance on the performance of solution synthesis in experience-based multi-agent decision making. In particular, we take a two-dimensional perspective to explore the use of diffusion distance and Euclidean distance in identifying 'similar' experiences--a key activity in the process of recognition-primed decision making. An experiment has been conducted on a data set including a large collection of battlefield decision experiences. It is shown that the performance of using diffusion distance can be significantly better than using Euclidean distance in the original experience space. This study allows us to generalize an anytime algorithm for multi-agent decision making, and it also opens the door to the application of diffusion geometry to multiagent research involving massive data analysis.},

As collaboration is key to learning in today's educational environment, mobile technology has tremendous potential in supporting and improving education and its delivery. Given that mobile technology for education is a new phenomenon that is gaining popularity, the values of using mobile technology to support education need to be further researched and better understood. In this research, we used the Value-Focused Thinking approach to interview students and instructors to identify the values of education that are enabled by mobile technology. These values are represented in the form of a means-ends objective network that not only captures the values of education facilitated by mobile technology but also depicts the relationships between these values. The means-ends objective network derived from this research can serve as a conceptual foundation for future studies and provide useful guidelines to practitioners for implementation of mobile technology in education.},

abstract = {To support thousands of concurrent players in virtual worlds simulated by contemporary Massively Multiplayer Online Games, most implementations employ static game world partitioning for distributing the load among multiple game server instances. Further, the resources that manage the resulting subregions are statically allocated, independent of the actual game load. As a result, due to the high variability of the user demand, this approach leads to a low resource utilization causing much higher provisioning costs than necessary. In addition, the number of players supported by a region is limited by the maximum load that can be handled by a single server instance.We propose in this paper a novel game load management technique divided in two (global and a local) layers, capable of dynamically adjusting the amount of allocated resources to the present user demand. The global level assigns the responsibility of serving particular game regions to data centers using a peer-to-peer infrastructure, while the local level within individual facilities maintains the necessary server instances for the assigned obligations. We device two generic heuristics based on the well-known bin-packing problem to achieve the ultimate goal of maximizing the resource utilization on both levels while maintaining user-level Quality of Service (QoS). We evaluate the performance of our proposed solution using simulation-based experiments, which demonstrate a potential cost reduction in maintaining MMOG sessions by up to 60% while maintaining QoS in 99% of the cases.},

Finally, we draw out three lessons for supporting agile modeling through experimentation: iterative development of models, providing appropriate domain-specific building blocks, and balancing the development of integrated tools versus interoperating with existing tools and the work practices that surround them.},
