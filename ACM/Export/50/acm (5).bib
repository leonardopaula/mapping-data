abstract = {"One Click Fraud" is an online confidence scam that has been plaguing an increasing number of Japanese Internet users, in spite of new laws and the mobilization of police task forces. In this scam, the victim clicks on a link presented to them, only to be informed that they just entered a binding contract and are required to pay a registration fee for a service. Even though no money is legally owed, a large number of users prefer to pay up, because of potential embarrassment due to the type of service "requested" (e.g., pornographic goods).Using public reports of fraudulent websites as a source of data, we analyze over 2,000 reported One Click Frauds incidents. By correlating several attributes (WHOIS data, bank accounts, phone numbers, malware installed...), we discover that a few fraudsters are seemingly responsible for a majority of the scams, and evidence a number of loopholes these miscreants exploit. We further show that, while some of these sites may also be engaging in other illicit activities such as spamming, the connection between different types of scams is not as obvious as we initially expected. Last, we show that the rise in the number of these frauds is fueled by high expected monetary gains in return for very little risk. The quantitative data obtained gives us an interesting window on the economic dynamics of some online criminal syndicates.},

abstract = {We propose to develop a portable, handheld, noninvasive solution for accurate screening and real-time monitoring of traumatic brain injury (BI) in ambulatory/emergency response scenarios. A layered sensing concept that unifies alternate modalities such as a) ultrasound (US), b) near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), c) tonometry (IOP), to predict BI, their severity and mode of recommendations for emergency medical service (EMS) personnel is offered. Specifically, we aim to determine i) novel 3D morphometric parameters of optic nerve sheath that can predict elevated intracranial pressure from US data, ii) incidence of intracranial hematomas using NIRS, iii) intraocular pressure using a tonometer, iv) cerebral blood flow and blood oxygen content using other auxiliary non-invasive sensing modes and v) finally provide a sensor fused outcome of all i)-iv) combined. This decision-support system (DSS) will improve BI detection by incorporating accurate on-site measurements that accounts for individual baseline variations and monitors temporal manifestation of the injury. The data collected and the preliminary analysis performed by the DSS will be sent to an emergency department (ED) physician stationed at a nearby trauma center via a wireless 3G network. Based on the available bandwidth, either all the data including the preliminary analysis (US video, images, 1D measurements, etc) or only the refined signals (feature vector extracted during screening) along with the DSS diagnosis will be sent to the physician. If the DSS determined output is agreeable to the physician then the screening can be terminated and the physician/ED staff can prepare to perform advanced interventions (intubation, cerebralspinal fluid (CSF) drainage, etc). If not, the on-call physician can inform the medic to repeat the scans/take additional measurements to obtain a more concrete outcome via the DSS. In summary, such a knowledge-driven system will equip a novice or a trained medic with an easy-to-use tool to detect traumatic BI and reduce the diagnosis time involved (i.e., computed tomography (CT) scan, clinical evaluation) in ED before performing advanced interventions and thereby improve the prognosis.},

abstract = {Patients with end stage renal diseases (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) have high morbidity and mortality due to multiple causes, one of which is dramatically higher fall rates than the general population. The mobility mechanisms that contribute to falls in this population must be understood if adequate interventions for fall prevention are to be achieved. This study utilizes emerging non-invasive, portable gait, posture, strength, and stability assessment technologies to extract various mobility parameters that research has shown to be predictive of fall risk in the general population. As part of an ongoing human subjects study, mobility measures such as postural and locomotion profiles were obtained from five (5) ESRD patients undergoing HD treatments. To assess the effects of post-HD-fatigue on fall risk, both the pre- and post-HD measurements were obtained. Additionally, the effects of inter-HD periods (two days vs. three days) were investigated using the non-invasive, wireless, body-worn motion capture technology and novel signal processing algorithms. The results indicated that HD treatment influenced strength and mobility (i.e., weaker and slower after the dialysis, increasing the susceptibility to falls while returning home) and inter-dialysis period influenced pre-HD profiles (increasing the susceptibility to falls before they come in for a HD treatment). Methodology for early detection of increased fall risk -- before a fall event occurs -- using the portable mobility assessment technology for out-patient monitoring is further explored, including targeting interventions to identified individuals for fall prevention.},

abstract = {Multiple sensor fusion is very important for wireless health monitoring since a single type of sensor usually can only provide limited aspects of the health condition while multiple sensors of different types hopefully can complement each other and yield more comprehensive aspects of the health condition. Many existing sensor fusion approaches are based on a flat structure, where multiple sensor features are treated as in the same layer and are fused by the feature-level fusion. In this paper we present a systematic approach using a structurally learned Bayesian Network (BN) for sensor fusion. The BN serves as a powerful framework that can integrate multiple sensor features in a hierarchy that is automatically learned via supervised learning. We present a hybrid structure learning approach that includes four steps and consists of both systematic global and local structure learning, as well as random perturbation for structure learning. Subsequent to the feature selection, we first learn an Augmented Bayesian Classifier (ABC) and it is followed by an extended K2 structure learning to search for a better structure in another structure subspace. Random structure learning is then performed to perturb the structure learning so as to avoid getting stuck in a local optimum. Finally, we perform local structure learning with hill-climbing by reversing or removing each link between features. The proposed hierarchical sensor fusion solution outperformed some conventional approaches such as Na\"{\i}ve Bayesian Classifier and Support Vector Machine classifier that integrate multiple sensor features by a flat feature-level fusion.},

Paramedics often consult with physicians before the patient reaches the hospital. To do this effectively, they must convey the patient's condition rapidly and effectively. Upon hospital arrival they must also transfer as much patient data as possible to ensure continuation of care. In this paper, we present a context-management framework for telemedicine that is designed to capture sensor data for transfer to a remote location. We further describe an application developed on top of the framework for emergency medicine. We examine design considerations for the application based on collaboration with medical personnel. Finally, we present technical results obtained from use of the technology in simulated emergency scenarios.},

abstract = {Insider threat problems are widespread in industry today, resulting in large losses of intellectual property. Reputable reports assert that attacks from within an organization are on the rise, making detection of insider-based attacks a top priority. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of using role-based differentiation of user behavior as a tool in detecting insider attack behavior. This differentiation is natural in contexts where role-based access control (RBAC) mechanisms are in place. Using synthetically generated traffic (which puts placement and intensity of insider behavior under experimental control), we train five different algorithms on "normal" behavior with and without RBAC differentiation, and measure the accuracy of detecting malicious behavior with, and without RBAC, as a function of insider behavior. We find that in some contexts RBAC differentiation significantly reduces these errors. However, in our experiments two of the five algorithms had statistically significant increases in false positives under RBAC as opposed to non-RBAC. However, these increases are small compared to the very large gain in detection capability that RBAC brings, and we conclude that RBAC is very much worth considering as a tool for insider threat detection.},

abstract = {The problem of automatically classifying the gender of a blog author has important applications in many commercial domains. Existing systems mainly use features such as words, word classes, and POS (part-of-speech) n-grams, for classification learning. In this paper, we propose two new techniques to improve the current result. The first technique introduces a new class of features which are variable length POS sequence patterns mined from the training data using a sequence pattern mining algorithm. The second technique is a new feature selection method which is based on an ensemble of several feature selection criteria and approaches. Empirical evaluation using a real-life blog data set shows that these two techniques improve the classification accuracy of the current state-of-the-art methods significantly.},

abstract = {Named-entity recognition (NER) is an important task required in a wide variety of applications. While rule-based systems are appealing due to their well-known "explainability," most, if not all, state-of-the-art results for NER tasks are based on machine learning techniques. Motivated by these results, we explore the following natural question in this paper: Are rule-based systems still a viable approach to named-entity recognition? Specifically, we have designed and implemented a high-level language NERL on top of SystemT, a general-purpose algebraic information extraction system. NERL is tuned to the needs of NER tasks and simplifies the process of building, understanding, and customizing complex rule-based named-entity annotators. We show that these customized annotators match or outperform the best published results achieved with machine learning techniques. These results confirm that we can reap the benefits of rule-based extractors' explainability without sacrificing accuracy. We conclude by discussing lessons learned while building and customizing complex rule-based annotators and outlining several research directions towards facilitating rule development.},

abstract = {Part-of-speech (POS) induction is one of the most popular tasks in research on unsupervised NLP. Many different methods have been proposed, yet comparisons are difficult to make since there is little consensus on evaluation framework, and many papers evaluate against only one or two competitor systems. Here we evaluate seven different POS induction systems spanning nearly 20 years of work, using a variety of measures. We show that some of the oldest (and simplest) systems stand up surprisingly well against more recent approaches. Since most of these systems were developed and tested using data from the WSJ corpus, we compare their generalization abilities by testing on both WSJ and the multilingual Multext-East corpus. Finally, we introduce the idea of evaluating systems based on their ability to produce cluster prototypes that are useful as input to a prototype-driven learner. In most cases, the prototype-driven learner outperforms the unsupervised system used to initialize it, yielding state-of-the-art results on WSJ and improvements on non-English corpora.},

In this paper we address the problem of modeling ideological perspective on a topical level using a factored topic model. We develop efficient inference algorithms using Collapsed Gibbs sampling for posterior inference, and give various evaluations and illustrations of the utility of our model on various document collections with promising results.

While specialised monitoring systems can be deployed to detect specific problems, more general systems are required to detect unexpected issues, and track performance trends.While large fleets of computers are becoming more common, few existing, general monitoring systems have the capability to scale to monitor these very large networks. There is also an absence of systems in the literature that cater for visualisation of monitoring information on a large scale.Scale is an issue in both the design and presentation of large-scale monitoring systems. We discuss Panopticon, a monitoring system that we have developed, which can scale to monitor tens of thousands of nodes, using only commodity equipment. In addition, we propose a novel method for visualising monitoring information on a large scale, based on general techniques for visualising massive multi-dimensional datasets.The monitoring system is shown to be able to collect information from up to 100 000 nodes. The storage system is able to record and output information from up to 25 000 nodes, and the visualisation is able to simultaneously display all this information for up to 20 000 nodes. Optimisations to our storage system could allow it to scale a little further, but a distributed storage approach combined with intelligent filtering algorithms would be necessary for significant improvements in scalability.},

abstract = {Economic activities in rural areas of developing countries are usually not strong enough to impact significantly in poverty alleviation and improve rural life. These communities are often marginalized in terms of basic infrastructures; low economic activities and limited markets. However, they possess market potentials in agriculture and micro-enterprises. Information and communication technologies can be use to develop these potentials by opening these markets beyond the local borders. Our objective is to explore the potentials of information technologies for rural economy development by bringing mobile added value to potential users. Our aim is to design a mobile user interface that will be easy to use by rural micro-entrepreneurs who have little or no previous experience of the mobile commerce technology. In order to design the application and user interface, we conducted a case study in Dwesa community and applied user-centered design methods in the design process. Qualitative and quantitative methods were used to gather user data. This paper presents the design process, and user evaluation of the prototype mobile user interface. The user evaluation of the prototype was conducted and the descriptive statistics of users' performance is presented. The result shows that the evaluators who had no prior experience with this technology recorded minimum tasks completion time and with few errors, and an increasing level of precision in task performance as they continue to use the interface; which is a positive indication on the usability of the user-interface.},

year = {2010},
publisher = {American Society for Information Science},
address = {USA},
abstract = {Adaptivity in IR interactions requires the IR systems adapting to users' situations and the users adapting to the systems. System adaption entails dynamic user modeling, effective information architecture and enhanced search features such as search integration and relevance feedback; user adaptation through interactions entails mental model building and modification towards a coherent state of knowledge and learning.The panel is structured as follows. Initially we provide an overview of the panel contents, consisting of four central dimensions of adaptivity in IR interaction. These are adaption 1) through integration of information objects; 2) of information system to searcher; 3) of searcher to information system; and 4) to context and practice. The sequence follows the order of the panellists, i.e., each panellist is the prime mover of a particular dimension.},

abstract = {The study develops an in-depth picture of teens' thoughts and opinions related to social networks and ICT's, particularly preferences towards, and concerns related to, their use. Using a series of six semi-structured focus group interviews, data were gathered from 45 high school seniors attending a highly technological public high school. Focus group questions included 1) preferred methods for communicating with friends and family; 2) reasons for engaging or not engaging in online social networking; 3) how ICT's for social networking and other communication purposes were selected; and 4) decisions related to accepting online "friends."Findings contradicted earlier "digital natives" literature, which suggests that teens are avid users of technology for technology's sake. Instead, the teens viewed ICTs and social networks from a more pragmatic view, using them as tools for quick and easy communication and for relationship building and maintenance.General findings indicated that 1) communication media were selected based on the closeness of the relationship with the message receiver(s) and the number of intended receivers; 2) social networks, such as Facebook, were used for less frequent contact with wider range of friends and relatives; 3) teens used ICTs differently for communication with adults than with peers; and 4) teens preferred to use email for interactions with teachers.An eight-category typology of four ICT capability preferences (Simplicity of interface design/Ease of use, Speed of use, Constant contact/Ubiquitous communication, and Multitasking) and four ICT use concerns (Information privacy, Information security, Communication overload; and Reduced face-to-face communication and interaction) is proposed.},

abstract = {As individuals' access to the Internet has grown, so has the diversity of lifestyles and interests represented on the web. On the Internet, members of any subculture can communicate and share information anonymously and directly on a variety of platforms. Although researchers from many disciplinary backgrounds have devoted considerable attention to the nature of information practices in online communities, there has been little investigation into the information practices of adherents to lifestyles that could be considered perilous or harmful. The members of such a group, referred to as Pro-Anorexia, or Pro-Ana, characterize themselves as believing that Anorexia is not a disease, but a lifestyle choice.This paper presents findings from a textual analysis of posts and comments on three Pro-Anorexia (Pro-Ana) weblogs. Using a Grounded Theory approach, we found that both bloggers and commenters share a diverse array of types of information in a variety of formats. Because much of the information sought and shared on Pro-Ana blogs would be considered dangerous in another venue, Pro-Ana blogs present an interesting forum for considering how the context in which information is solicited, encountered, or presented actively shapes both the information itself and the information practices of community members.},

abstract = {The on-chip communication architecture presented in this paper, NeuroNoC, addresses the problems arising in large multi-core systems where global or local routing strategies do not work efficiently anymore since they either do not scale or lack information on the network state. Our communication architecture is runtime adaptive and it deploys a distributed artificial neural network to aid routing decisions. It thereby provides a light-weight mechanism for local routing information to propagate through the communication architecture and is capable of self-organizing efficiently (since scalable) to varying communication workload scenarios. The underlying basic concepts are borrowed from spiking neural networks, a special case of artificial neural networks. Our experiments show that already with low hardware overhead, a significant improvement of the runtime routing behavior compared to current state-of-the-art approaches is possible. We report an improvement of 23% in routing quality compared to wXY [9] routing in terms of failed transactions.},

abstract = {Social multimedia hosting and sharing websites, such as Flickr, Facebook, Youtube, Picasa, ImageShack and Photobucket, are increasingly popular around the globe. A major trend in the current studies on social multimedia is using the social media sites as a source of huge amount of labeled data for solving large scale computer science problems in computer vision, data mining and multimedia. In this paper, we take a new path to explore the global trends and sentiments that can be drawn by analyzing the sharing patterns of uploaded and downloaded social multimedia. In a sense, each time an image or video is uploaded or viewed, it constitutes an implicit vote for (or against) the subject of the image. This vote carries along with it a rich set of associated data including time and (often) location information. By aggregating such votes across millions of Internet users, we reveal the wisdom that is embedded in social multimedia sites for social science applications such as politics, economics, and marketing. We believe that our work opens a brand new arena for the multimedia research community with a potentially big impact on society and social sciences.},

In some individuals these behaviors occur with very high frequency and can be disruptive and at times self-injurious. We propose a system that can tacitly collect contextual data related to the individual's physiological state and their external environment, and map it to occurrences of stereotypies. A user study was conducted with children with ASD, parents, and caregivers to explore and validate this concept. A prototype of the system, developed through participatory design, was used in the study as a probe to elicit the information needs of these stakeholders, and provide a better understanding of the nuances involved in supporting those needs. Here we present the findings of this study, and four design recommendations; promoting ecological integration, addressing privacy concerns, supporting inference, and enabling customization.},

abstract = {Text mining, though still a nascent industry, has been growing quickly along with the awareness of the importance of unstructured data in business analytics, customer retention and extension, social media, and legal applications. There has been a recent increase in the number of commercial text mining product and service offerings, but successful or wide-spread deployments are rare, mainly due to a dependence on the expertise and skill of practitioners. Accordingly, there is a growing need for re-usable repositories for text mining. In this paper, we focus on dictionary-based text mining and its role in enabling practitioners in understanding and analyzing large text datasets. We motivate and define the problem of exploratory dictionary construction for capturing concepts of interest, and propose a framework for efficient construction, tuning, and re-use of these dictionaries across datasets. The construction framework offers a range of interaction modes to the user to quickly build concept dictionaries over large datasets. We also show how to adapt one or more dictionaries across domains and tasks, thereby enabling reuse of knowledge and effort in industrial practice. We present results and case studies on real-life CRM analytics datasets, where such repositories and tooling significantly cut down practitioner time and effort for dictionary-based text mining.},

abstract = {Maximum available Web prediction techniques typically follow Markov model for Web based prediction. Everybody knows that there are lots of Web links or URLs on any Web page. So, it is very hard to predict the next Web page from the huge number of Web links. Existing approaches predict successfully on the private (personal) computer using different Markov models. In case of public (like cyber cafe) computers, prediction can not be done at all, since many people use the same machine in this type of scenario. In this paper, we propose a new policy on Web prediction using the dynamic behavior of users. We demonstrate four procedures for Web based prediction to make it faster. Our technique does not require any Web-log or usage history at client machine. We are going to use the mouse movement and its direction for the prediction of next Web page. We track the mouse position and its respective direction instead of using Markov model. In this research work, we introduce a fully dynamic Web prediction scheme, since Web-log or any type of static or previous information has not been utilized in our approach. In this paper, we try to minimize the number of Web links to be considered of any Web page in runtime for achieving better accuracy in dynamic Web prediction. Our approach shows the step-wise build-up of a solid Web prediction program which is appropriate in both the private as well as public scenario. Overall, this method shows a new way for prediction using dynamic nature of the respective users.},

abstract = {Information retrieval in search advertising, as in other ad-hoc retrieval tasks, aims to find the most appropriate ranking of the ad documents of a corpus for a given query. In addition to ranking the ad documents, we also need to filter or threshold irrelevant ads from participating in the auction to be displayed alongside search results. In this work, we describe our experience in implementing a successful ad retrieval system for a commercial search engine based on the Language Modeling (LM) framework for retrieval. The LM demonstrates significant performance improvements over the baseline vector space model (TF-IDF) system that was in production at the time. From a modeling perspective, we propose a novel approach to incorporate query segmentation and phrases in the LM framework, discuss impact of score normalization for relevance filtering, and present preliminary results of incorporating query expansions using query rewriting techniques. From an implementation perspective, we also discuss real-time latency constraints of a production search engine and how we overcome them by adapting the WAND algorithm to work with language models. In sum, our LM formulation is considerably better in terms of accuracy metrics such as Precision-Recall (10% improvement in AUC) and nDCG (8% improvement in nDCG@5) on editorial data and also demonstrates significant improvements in clicks in live user tests (0.787% improvement in Click Yield, with 8% coverage increase). Finally, we hope that this paper provides the reader with adequate insights into the challenges of building a system that serves millions of users every day.},

abstract = {The probability that a term appears in relevant documents (P(t | R)) is a fundamental quantity in several probabilistic retrieval models, however it is difficult to estimate without relevance judgments or a relevance model. We call this value term necessity because it measures the percentage of relevant documents retrieved by the term - how necessary a term's occurrence is to document relevance. Prior research typically either set this probability to a constant, or estimated it based on the term's inverse document frequency, neither of which was very effective.This paper identifies several factors that affect term necessity, for example, a term's topic centrality, synonymy and abstractness. It develops term- and query-dependent features for each factor that enable supervised learning of a predictive model of term necessity from training data. Experiments with two popular retrieval models and 6 standard datasets demonstrate that using predicted term necessity estimates as user term weights of the original query terms leads to significant improvements in retrieval accuracy.},

However, this approach is usually chosen because of ease of tracking rather than its ability to convey affect. We have conducted an experiment that evaluated the perceptual importance of 22 such automatically tracked feature points in a mental state recognition task. The experiment compared mental state recognition rates of participants who viewed videos of human actors and synthetic characters (physical android robot, virtual avatar, and virtual stick figure drawings) enacting various facial expressions. All expressions made by the synthetic characters were automatically generated using the 22 tracked facial feature points on the videos of the human actors. Our results show no difference in accuracy across the three synthetic representations, however, all three were less accurate than the original human actor videos that generated them. Overall, facial expressions showing surprise were more easily identifiable than other mental states, suggesting that a geometric approach to synthesis may be better suited toward some mental states than others.},

abstract = {Valid, reliable and quick measurement of emotion and affect is an important challenge for the use of emotion and affect in human-technology interaction. Emotion and affect can be measured in two different ways: explicit, the user is asked for feedback, and implicit, signals from the users are automatically translated to affective and emotional meaning (affect recognition). Here we focus on explicit affective feedback. More specifically, we focus on the evaluation of an affect measurement tool called the AffectButton. Previous evaluation studies [2] showed that the AffectButton enables users to give affective feedback in a low-effort, reliable and valid way. In this paper we report a study involving real-time affective labeling of movie music by primarily high school students, i.e., a realistic domain with mainstream users. Our results show that (a) users (n=21) are able to use the AffectButton in real time while listening to the music; (b) the labeling very-well follows the changes in the music and gives insight into the different affective dimensions of the music, and; (c) objective music properties correlate to these affective dimensions replicating findings of others. This provides evidence that the AffectButton is a viable affect measurement tool usable by non-expert users in real-time realistic domains.},

The results from a human subject study show that the variables included in our model have important effects on subjects' decision making and performance in our experimental tasks.

The extended system enhances Joke-o-mat's capability to browse a sitcom by scene, punchline, dialog segment, and actor with word-level keyword search. The indexing is performed based on the alignment of the multimedia content with closed captions and "found" fan-generated scripts processed with speech and speaker recognition systems. This significantly reduces the amount of manual intervention required for training new episodes, and the final narrative-theme segmentation has proven indistinguishable from expert annotation. This article describes the new Joke-o-mat system, discusses problems with using fan-generated data, and presents results on episodes from the sitcom Seinfeld, showing segmentation accuracy and user satisfaction as determined by a human-subject study.},

abstract = {In the age of content snacking and mobisodes (mobile episodes) the paradigm of media consumption is radically changing. Media consumption is moving from monolithic, prepackaged, well-edited, and elaborate content presentation to a continuous feed of brief segments as singleton episodes and few-minutes videos, that are often supported by or initiated via tweets and status updates. In these updates, attention spans are small and the content packaging is less relevant with respect to the dynamic, 'streaming' aspect of information. This trend has a profound influence on the segmentation requirements that are needed to make this stream of possible information. In this paper, we present a novel method to automatically extract structured content, events, where events include major cast interviews, dialogs, background segments, etc. from news video in an unsupervised fashion. Two key ideas differentiate this unsupervised method from the others: the type of information that we use to find events and the method utilized to combine this information for coherent multimedia events. The proposed system exploits audio, visual appearance, detected faces, and mid-level semantic concepts from every video shot, but instead of combining everything together, the framework clusters them independently and by applying coherence rules assembles the multimedia events. Additionally, we discuss the effect of segmentation errors in practical retrieval and content consumption tasks.},

Green computing aims at the development of technologies for a greener and more sustainable planet. In this work we focus on the greening of data centers that house servers on campuses. It is known that servers consume a huge amount of power and incur other costs in cooling and related operations. It is challenging to meet the demands of efficiency and accuracy in data centers while yet promoting a greener environment along with cost cutting. Our work proposes a decision support system based on decision trees and case-based reasoning that mines existing data in order to assist decision-making for better management in data centers. We consider various aspects of the data from an environmental management perspective such as carbon footprint, thermal profiles and virtualization. Issues such as efficiency and accuracy are taken into account here, In this proposal paper, we outline the need for our work, the challenges involved, the proposed approach for building the system, preliminary evaluation and future plans. This work would be of interest to the data and knowledge management community as well as environmental scientists and researchers in related areas.},

abstract = {Abstract Previous methods of network anomaly detection have focused on defining a temporal model of what is "normal," and flagging the "abnormal" activity that does not fit into this pre-trained construct. When monitoring traffic to and from IP addresses on a large network, this problem can become computationally complex, and potentially intractable, as a state model must be maintained for each address. In this paper, we present a method of detecting anomalous network activity without providing any historical context. By exploiting the size of the network along with the minimal overhead of NetFlow data, we are able to model groups of hosts performing similar functions to discover anomalous behavior. As a collection, these anomalies can be further described with a few high-level characterizations and we provide a means for creating and labeling these categories. We demonstrate our method on a very large-scale network consisting of 30 million unique addresses, focusing specifically on traffic related to web servers.},

Our definition of cloud data centers includes not only data centers employed by large online service providers offering Internet-facing applications but also data centers used to host data-intensive (MapReduce style) applications). We collect and analyze SNMP statistics, topology and packet-level traces. We examine the range of applications deployed in these data centers and their placement, the flow-level and packet-level transmission properties of these applications, and their impact on network and link utilizations, congestion and packet drops. We describe the implications of the observed traffic patterns for data center internal traffic engineering as well as for recently proposed architectures for data center networks.},

In this paper, we present an evaluation framework for data stream mining for traffic applications. We apply a traffic simulation software to emulate the generation of traffic data by mobile probes. The framework is evaluated in a first case study, namely queue-end detection. We show first results of the evaluation of a data stream mining method, varying multiple parameters for the traffic simulation.

Most of similarities are defined based on the geographic features of mobile users' trajectories. However, trajectories geographically close may not necessarily be similar because the activities implied by nearby landmarks they pass through may be different. In this paper, we argue that a better similarity measurement should have taken into account the semantics of trajectories. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for recommending potential friends based on users' semantic trajectories for location-based social networks. The core of our proposal is a novel trajectory similarity measurement, namely, Maximal Semantic Trajectory Pattern Similarity (MSTP-Similarity), which measures the semantic similarity between trajectories. Accordingly, we propose a user similarity measurement based on MSTP-Similarity of user trajectories and use it as the basis for recommending potential friends to a user. Through experimental evaluation, the proposed friend recommendation approach is shown to deliver excellent performance.},

abstract = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are hard to program due to unconventional programming models used to satisfy stringent resource constraints. The common event-driven concurrent programming model and lack of kernel protection in these systems introduce the possibility of several subtle faults such as race conditions. These faults are often triggered by unexpected interleavings of events in the real world, and can occur long after their causes. Reproducing a fault from the trace of the past events can play a crucial role in debugging such faults. The same tight constraints that motivate the specific programming model however make tracing challenging. This paper proposes an efficient intra-procedural and inter-procedural control-flow tracing algorithm that generates the traces of all interleaving concurrent events. Our approach enables reproducing faults at a later stage, allowing the programmer to identify them effectively. We argue for the accuracy of our approach through case studies, and illustrate its low overhead through measurements and simulations.},

Recently, computer-based modeling and simulation technologies have emerged to support investigation of the dynamics of crowds, such as a crowd's behaviors under normal and emergent situations. This article assesses the major existing technologies for crowd modeling and simulation. We first propose a two-dimensional categorization mechanism to classify existing work depending on the size of crowds and the time-scale of the crowd phenomena of interest. Four evaluation criteria have also been introduced to evaluate existing crowd simulation systems from the point of view of both a modeler and an end-user.We have discussed some influential existing work in crowd modeling and simulation regarding their major features, performance as well as the technologies used in this work. We have also discussed some open problems in the area. This article will provide the researchers with useful information and insights on the state of the art of the technologies in crowd modeling and simulation as well as future research directions.},
