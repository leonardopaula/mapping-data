abstract = {We discuss how gaming can be used as a training strategy for students who are blind or visually impaired (SBVI) to develop embodied skill in use of haptic assistive technology. The technology takes the form of a haptic glove that is designed to give SBVI access to the pointing behavior of teachers in mathematics/science instruction that is performed in conjunction with speech and the use of instructional graphics. Our initial studies show that significant 'embodied skill' was required to afford fluent multimodal communication between the instructor and student. We developed a gaming strategy, employing flow theory to enhance the fun and engagement of the SBVI to promote extensive perceptual training. Our results showed significant improvement and interaction gains as the game-play progressed over multiple sessions. Results also indicate that skills developed through game play were persistent, and transferable to complex multimodal situated discourse conditions.},

Our system enables automated analysis of thousands of images, where manual processing would be infeasible. We automate the analysis of raw imaging data using statistics that are tailored to the task of interest. These “features” are a representation to be fed to classifiers that exploit spatial and temporal consistencies. Our testbed can detect the presence or absence of a bird with an accuracy of 82%, count eggs with an accuracy of 84%, and detect the inception of the nesting stage within a day. Our results demonstrate the challenges and potential benefits of using imagers as biological sensors. An exploration of system performance under varying image resolution and frame rate suggest that an in situ adaptive vision system is technically feasible.},

We report the adoption of a media computation context in a majors' CS1 course at a large, selective R1 institution in the U.S. The main goal was to increase retention of majors, but do so by replacing the traditional CS1 course directly (fully preparing students for the subsequent course). In this paper we provide an experience report for instructors interested in this approach. We compare a traditional CS1 with a media computation CS1 in terms of desired student competencies (analyzed via programming assignments and exams) and find the media computation approach to focus more on problem solving and less on language issues. In comparing student success (analyzed via pass rates and retention rates one year later) we find pass rates to be statistically significantly higher with media computation both for majors and for the class as a whole. We give examples of media computation exam questions and programming assignments and share student and instructor experiences including advice for the new instructor.},

abstract = {User profiling is commonly used to support personalization as well as to enhance usability of software systems by automatically adapting to the needs and preferences of their users. This paper presents an approach to dynamically update mobile users' profiles so that they can be provided with appropriate services while moving from one location to another. We propose an XML generic user profile structure that is dynamically updatable as the user experiences new services and that can be used by different software systems and applications. The proposed profile learning mechanism makes use of clustering users with a subset of similar attributes to predict appropriate services to a new user, and segmenting services with a subset of similar usage to discover and recommend new services that might be of interests to a mobile user. We demonstrated the feasibility of our approach by presenting a case study in tourism where tourists are assisted during their travels by providing them with services and information of interest. The tourist preferences and her/his current location are incorporated in the proactive formulation of suggestions on the tourist mobile devices about nearby points of interests (e.g. museums, restaurants...).},

abstract = {This article provides an empirical analysis of data collected during the implementation of a teaching proposal on thermodynamics in a class of 20 students (17 year-olds) of a scientifically-oriented secondary school in Italy. During the activities, each student made evident progress in gaining intellectual autonomy as they took part in the teaching/learning dynamics of the classroom. Although the research had, up to now, an empirical orientation, this paper aims to provide a contribution for advancing theory development in physics education research. The study gives an example of the application of a specific model of teaching/learning (the Model of Longitudinal Development) that acted as "framework for action" in the design of the learning environment as "properly complex territory." The data analysis gives indications for how to develop a theoretical understanding of the concept of "personal learning trajectory" and it provides a basis for exploring the factors that can trigger intellectual autonomy.},

abstract = {Preparing citizens to address the complex problems inherent in cities requires our changing society to embrace a new kind of education. One way to train people to think about complex problems is to identify and study how professionals who think in those ways develop their epistemic frame. In this paper, we examine one of the ways urban planners master and appropriate relevant expertise through an ethnographic study of an urban planning practicum. Specifically, we use a new method called epistemic network analysis to look at presentation feedback sessions during two weeks of the practicum to explore emergent relationships between the teacher's planning expertise and the students' expertise. The results of this study indicate that epistemic network analysis offers a technique for analyzing the kinds of situated understanding that result from sociocultural learning and for observing the translation of pedagogy into practice in various types of learning environments.},

In our research project, Kitchen Science Investigators, we aim to start with learners' interests and goals in cooking. We then help them connect cooking to science, using play to help them see food as an object of investigation. We then transition learners into engaging in authentic scientific practices.

abstract = {IntroductionComputer science applications are becoming more and more network centric, ubiquitous, knowledge intensive, and computing demanding. This trend will result soon in an ecosystem of pervasive applications and services that professionals and end-users can exploit everywhere. Recently, collections of IT services and applications, such as Web services and Cloud computing services, became available opening the way for accessing computing services as public utilities, like water, gas and electricity.Key technologies for implementing that perspective are Cloud computing and Web services, semantic Web and ontologies, pervasive computing, P2P systems, Grid computing, ambient intelligence architectures, data mining and knowledge discovery tools, Web 2.0 facilities, mashup tools, and decentralized programming models. In fact, it is mandatory to develop solutions that integrate some or many of those technologies to provide future knowledge-intensive software utilities. The Grid paradigm can represent a key component of the future Internet, a cyber infrastructure for efficiently supporting that scenario.Grid and Cloud computing are evolved models of distributed computing and parallel processing technologies. The Grid is a distributed computing infrastructure that enables coordinated resource sharing within dynamic organizations consisting of individuals, institutions, and resources. In the area of Grid computing a proposed approach in accordance with the trend outlined above is the Service-Oriented Knowledge Utilities (SOKU) model that envisions the integrated use of a set of technologies that are considered as a solution to information, knowledge and communication needs of many knowledge-based industrial and business applications. The SOKU approach stems from the necessity of providing knowledge and processing capabilities to everybody, thus supporting the advent of a competitive knowledge-based economy. Although the SOKU model is not yet implemented, Grids are increasingly equipped with data management tools, semantic technologies, complex work-flows, data mining features and other Web intelligence approaches. Similar efforts are currently devoted to develop knowledge and intelligent Clouds. These technologies can facilitate the process of having Grids and Clouds as strategic components for supporting pervasive knowledge intensive applications and utilities.Grids were originally designed for dealing with problems involving large amounts of data and/or compute-intensive applications. Today, however, Grids enlarged their horizon as they are going to run business applications supporting consumers and end-users. To face those new challenges, Grid environments must support adaptive knowledge management and data analysis applications by offering resources, services, and decentralized data access mechanisms. In particular, according to the service-oriented architecture (SOA) model, data mining tasks and knowledge discovery processes can be delivered as services in Grid-based infrastructures.Through a service-based approach we can define integrated services for supporting distributed business intelligence tasks in Grids. Those services can address all the aspects that must be considered in data mining and in knowledge discovery processes such as data selection and transport, data analysis, knowledge models representation and visualization. We worked in this direction for providing Grid-based architectures and services for distributed knowledge discovery such as the Knowledge Grid the Weka4WS toolkit, and mobile Grid services for data mining.Here we describe a strategy and a model based on the use of services for the design of distributed knowledge discovery services and discuss how Grid frameworks, such those mentioned above, can be developed as a collection of services and how they can be used to develop distributed data analysis tasks and knowledge discovery processes using the SOA model.},

However comparatively little research has been carried out to date on this topic in general, and more notably, on agile methods in particular. This dearth of evidence in the case of agile methods is especially significant in that it is reasonable to expect that such methods would particularly lend themselves to tailoring. In this research, we present a framework based on interviews with 20 senior software development researchers and a review of the extant literature. The framework is comprised of two sets of factors—characteristics of the method, and developer practices—that can improve method tailoring effectiveness. Drawing on the framework, we then interviewed 16 expert XP practitioners to examine the current state and effectiveness of XP tailoring efforts, and to shed light on issues the framework identified as being important. The article concludes with a set of recommendations for research and practice that would advance our understanding of the method tailoring area.},

As experimental conditions we investigate different forms of textual context and linguistic complexity classes relative to syntax and semantics. Our data renders evidence that annotation performance depends on the semantic and syntactic complexity of the decision points and, more interestingly, indicates that full-scale context is mostly negligible - with the exception of semantic high-complexity cases. We then induce from this observational data a cognitively grounded cost model of linguistic meta-data annotations and compare it with existing non-cognitive models. Our data reveals that the cognitively founded model explains annotation costs (expressed in annotation time) more adequately than non-cognitive ones.},

We relate our findings to research on word frequency distributions and to discourse analytic studies of perspective.},

We exploit the metadata intrinsically present in User Generated Content (UGC) to bias automatic multi-document summarization techniques toward high quality information. We adopt a representation of concepts alternative to n-grams and propose two concept-scoring functions based on semantic overlap. Experimental results on data drawn from Yahoo!

We show that the information contained in the best answers voted by users of cQA portals can be successfully complemented by our method.},

title = {Practical Very Large Scale CRFs},
year = {2010},
abstract = {Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) are a widely-used approach for supervised sequence labelling, notably due to their ability to handle large description spaces and to integrate structural dependency between labels. Even for the simple linear-chain model, taking structure into account implies a number of parameters and a computational effort that grows quadratically with the cardinality of the label set. In this paper, we address the issue of training very large CRFs, containing up to hundreds output labels and several billion features. Efficiency stems here from the sparsity induced by the use of a l penalty term. Based on our own implementation, we compare three recent proposals for implementing this regularization strategy. Our experiments demonstrate that very large CRFs can be trained efficiently and that very large models are able to improve the accuracy, while delivering compact parameter sets.},

year = {2010},
abstract = {We show how web mark-up can be used to improve unsupervised dependency parsing. Starting from raw bracketings of four common HTML tags (anchors, bold, italics and underlines), we refine approximate partial phrase boundaries to yield accurate parsing constraints. Conversion procedures fall out of our linguistic analysis of a newly available million-word hyper-text corpus. We demonstrate that derived constraints aid grammar induction by training Klein and Manning's Dependency Model with Valence (DMV) on this data set: parsing accuracy on Section 23 (all sentences) of the Wall Street Journal corpus jumps to 50.4%, beating previous state-of-the-art by more than 5%. Web-scale experiments show that the DMV, perhaps because it is unlexicalized, does not benefit from orders of magnitude more annotated but noisier data. Our model, trained on a single blog, generalizes to 53.3% accuracy out-of-domain, against the Brown corpus --- nearly 10% higher than the previous published best. The fact that web mark-up strongly correlates with syntactic structure may have broad applicability in NLP.},

We interviewed 12 organizations, which were selected to represent different polar types of software production. The interviews were tape-recorded and transcribed for further analysis. The study yielded hypotheses which were derived by applying the qualitative grounded theory method. The results indicated that in practice, agile methods can improve the position of testing through the early involvement of testing activities in development, and also have a positive influence on end-product satisfaction. By applying these results, organizations can improve their processes and avoid pitfalls when transitioning to agile methods.},

title = {Towards Relational POMDPs for Adaptive Dialogue Management},
year = {2010},
publisher = {Association for Computational Linguistics},
address = {USA},
abstract = {Open-ended spoken interactions are typically characterised by both structural complexity and high levels of uncertainty, making dialogue management in such settings a particularly challenging problem. Traditional approaches have focused on providing theoretical accounts for either the uncertainty or the complexity of spoken dialogue, but rarely considered the two issues simultaneously. This paper describes ongoing work on a new approach to dialogue management which attempts to fill this gap. We represent the interaction as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) over a rich state space incorporating both dialogue, user, and environment models. The tractability of the resulting POMDP can be preserved using a mechanism for dynamically constraining the action space based on prior knowledge over locally relevant dialogue structures. These constraints are encoded in a small set of general rules expressed as a Markov Logic network. The first-order expressivity of Markov Logic enables us to leverage the rich relational structure of the problem and efficiently abstract over large regions of the state and action spaces.},

The local structures consist of reference “patches” and reference triangles, both obtained from inter-sensor distances. We elaborate on the relationship between the ARAP algorithm and other state-of-the-art algorithms, and provide experimental results demonstrating that ARAP is significantly less sensitive to sparse connectivity and measurement noise. We also show how ARAP may be distributed.},

abstract = {An increasing number of high-tech devices, such as driver monitoring systems and Internet usage monitoring tools, are advertised as useful or even necessary for good parenting of teens. Simultaneously, there is a growing market for mobile "personal safety" devices. As these trends merge, there will be significant implications for parent-teen relationships, affecting domains such as privacy, trust, and maturation. Not only the teen and his or her parents are affected; other important stakeholders include the teen's friends who may be unwittingly monitored. This problem space, with less clear-cut assets, risks, and affected parties, thus lies well outside of more typical computer security applications.To help understand this problem domain and what, if anything, should be built, we turn to the theory and methods of Value Sensitive Design, a systematic approach to designing for human values in technology. We first develop value scenarios that highlight potential issues, benefits, harms, and challenges. We then conducted semi-structured interviews with 18 participants (9 teens and their parents). Results show significant differences with respect to information about: 1) internal state (e.g., mood) versus external environment (e.g., location) state; 2) situation (e.g., emergency vs. non-emergency); and 3) awareness (e.g., notification vs. non-notification). The value scenario and interview results positioned us to identify key technical challenges -- such as strongly protecting the privacy of a teen's contextual information during ordinary situations but immediately exposing that information to others as appropriate in an emergency -- and corresponding architectural levers for these technologies.In addition to laying a foundation for future work in this area, this research serves as a prototypical example of using Value Sensitive Design to explicate the underlying human values in complex security domains.},

abstract = {Recent years have seen a proliferation of secure device pairing methods that try to improve both the usability and security of today's de-facto standard -- PIN-based authentication. Evaluating such improvements is difficult. Most comparative laboratory studies have so far mainly focused on completeness, trying to find the single best method among the dozens of proposed approaches -- one that is both rated the most usable by test subjects, and which provides the most robust security guarantees. This search for the "best" pairing method, however, fails to take into account the variety of situations in which such pairing protocols may be used in real life. The comparative study reported here, therefore, explicitly situates pairing tasks in a number of more realistic situations. Our results indicate that people do not always use the easiest or most popular method -- they instead prefer different methods in different situations, based on the sensitivity of data involved, their time constraints, and the social conventions appropriate for a particular place and setting. Our study also provides qualitative data on factors influencing the perceived security of a particular method, the users' mental models surrounding security of a method, and their security needs.},

The rise of botnets has amplified this problem; attackers compromise these computers, aggregate them, and use the resulting network to attack third parties. Despite a large security industry that provides software and advice, home computer users remain vulnerable. I identify eight 'folk models' of security threats that are used by home computer users to decide what security software to use, and which expert security advice to follow: four conceptualizations of 'viruses' and other malware, and four conceptualizations of 'hackers' that break into computers. I illustrate how these models are used to justify ignoring expert security advice. Finally, I describe one reason why botnets are so difficult to eliminate: they cleverly take advantage of gaps in these models so that many home computer users do not take steps to protect against them.},

Implicit feedback techniques have been employed in the past to address many of these issues. Although this was a step towards the right direction, a need to personalise and tailor the search experience to the user-specific needs has become evident. In this study we examine ways of personalising affective models trained on facial expression data. Using personalised data we adapt these models to individual users and compare their performance to a general model. The main goal is to determine whether the behavioural differences of users have an impact on the models' ability to determine topical relevance and if, by personalising them, we can improve their accuracy. For modelling relevance we extract a set of features from the facial expression data and classify them using Support Vector Machines. Our initial evaluation indicates that accounting for individual differences and applying personalisation introduces, in most cases, a noticeable improvement in the models' performance.},

What are some queries almost exclusively issued by African Americans? These are some of the questions we address in this study.Our research combines three data sources: the query log of a major US-based web search engine, profile information provided by 28 million of its users (birth year, gender and ZIP code), and US-census information including detailed demographic information aggregated at the level of ZIP code. Through this combination we can annotate each query with, e.g. the average per-capita income in the ZIP code it originated from. Though conceptually simple, this combination immediately creates a powerful user modeling tool.The main contributions of this work are the following. First, we provide a demographic description of a large sample of search engine users in the US and show that it agrees well with the distribution of the US population. Second, we describe how different segments of the population differ in their search behavior, e.g. with respect to the queries they formulate or the URLs they click. Third, we explore applications of our methodology to improve web search relevance and to provide better query suggestions.These results enable a wide range of applications including improving web search and advertising where, for instance, targeted advertisements for "family vacations" could be adapted to the (expected) income.},

We characterize the possible adversaries interested in disclosing Web site confidential data and the attack strategies that they could use. These attacks are based on different vulnerabilities found in query log for which we present several anonymization heuristics to prevent them. We perform an experimental evaluation to estimate the remaining utility of the log after the application of our anonymization techniques. Our experimental results show that a query log can be anonymized against these specific attacks while retaining a significant volume of useful data.},

For this situation, we engage the latest evidence and principles of cognition to help map requirements to information design for an interactive learning system.Our system seeks to improve the structural understanding of architects and to teach relationships between form and structure in long-span systems. We provide both explanatory multimedia resources and interactive resources including a Web-based modeling and simulation tool that aids architecture students with better understanding of the relationship between structure and form in design. We describe our design process and the system and examine the qualitative impact of the cognitive ergonomic process. This extra step in the usability design process of mapping expert knowledge to human perception and cognition can increase awareness of the requirements of a learning system and improve the effectiveness of the subsequent design.},

abstract = {Crisis Management and Disaster Recovery have gained immense importance in the wake of recent man and nature inflicted calamities. A critical problem in a crisis situation is how to efficiently discover, collect, organize, search and disseminate real-time disaster information. In this paper, we address several key problems which inhibit better information sharing and collaboration between both private and public sector participants for disaster management and recovery. We design and implement a web based prototype implementation of a Business Continuity Information Network (BCIN) system utilizing the latest advances in data mining technologies to create a user-friendly, Internet-based, information-rich service and acting as a vital part of a company's business continuity process. Specifically, information extraction is used to integrate the input data from different sources; the content recommendation engine and the report summarization module provide users personalized and brief views of the disaster information; the community generation module develops spatial clustering techniques to help users build dynamic community in disasters. Currently, BCIN has been exercised at Miami-Dade County Emergency Management.},

abstract = {Developing data mining algorithms that are suitable for cloud computing platforms is currently an active area of research, as is developing cloud computing platforms appropriate for data mining. Currently, the most common benchmark for cloud computing is the Terasort (and related) benchmarks. Although the Terasort Benchmark is quite useful, it was not designed for data mining per se. In this paper, we introduce a benchmark called MalStone that is specifically designed to measure the performance of cloud computing middleware that supports the type of data intensive computing common when building data mining models. We also introduce MalGen, which is a utility for generating data on clouds that can be used with MalStone.},

abstract = {Systems biology has made massive strides in recent years, with capabilities to model complex systems including cell division, stress response, energy metabolism, and signaling pathways. Concomitant with their improved modeling capabilities, however, such biochemical network models have also become notoriously complex for humans to comprehend. We propose network comprehension as a key problem for the KDD community, where the goal is to create explainable representations of complex biological networks. We formulate this problem as one of extracting temporal signatures from multi-variate time series data, where the signatures are composed of ordinal comparisons between time series components. We show how such signatures can be inferred by formulating the data mining problem as one of feature selection in rank-order space. We propose five new feature selection strategies for rank-order space and assess their selective superiorities. Experimental results on budding yeast cell cycle models demonstrate compelling results comparable to human interpretations of the cell cycle.},

abstract = {Modern data mining settings involve a combination of attribute-valued descriptors over entities as well as specified relationships between these entities. We present an approach to cluster such non-homogeneous datasets by using the relationships to impose either dependent clustering or disparate clustering constraints. Unlike prior work that views constraints as boolean criteria, we present a formulation that allows constraints to be satisfied or violated in a smooth manner. This enables us to achieve dependent clustering and disparate clustering using the same optimization framework by merely maximizing versus minimizing the objective function. We present results on both synthetic data as well as several real-world datasets.},

abstract = {User generated information in online communities has been characterized with the mixture of a text stream and a network structure both changing over time. A good example is a web-blogging community with the daily blog posts and a social network of bloggers.An important task of analyzing an online community is to observe and track the popular events, or topics that evolve over time in the community. Existing approaches usually focus on either the burstiness of topics or the evolution of networks, but ignoring the interplay between textual topics and network structures.In this paper, we formally define the problem of popular event tracking in online communities (PET), focusing on the interplay between texts and networks. We propose a novel statistical method that models the the popularity of events over time, taking into consideration the burstiness of user interest, information diffusion on the network structure, and the evolution of textual topics. Specifically, a Gibbs Random Field is defined to model the influence of historic status and the dependency relationships in the graph; thereafter a topic model generates the words in text content of the event, regularized by the Gibbs Random Field. We prove that two classic models in information diffusion and text burstiness are special cases of our model under certain situations. Empirical experiments with two different communities and datasets (i.e., Twitter and DBLP) show that our approach is effective and outperforms existing approaches.},

abstract = {Twitter is a user-generated content system that allows its users to share short text messages, called tweets, for a variety of purposes, including daily conversations, URLs sharing and information news. Considering its world-wide distributed network of users of any age and social condition, it represents a low level news flashes portal that, in its impressive short response time, has the principal advantage.In this paper we recognize this primary role of Twitter and we propose a novel topic detection technique that permits to retrieve in real-time the most emergent topics expressed by the community. First, we extract the contents (set of terms) of the tweets and model the term life cycle according to a novel aging theory intended to mine the emerging ones. A term can be defined as emerging if it frequently occurs in the specified time interval and it was relatively rare in the past. Moreover, considering that the importance of a content also depends on its source, we analyze the social relationships in the network with the well-known Page Rank algorithm in order to determine the authority of the users. Finally, we leverage a navigable topic graph which connects the emerging terms with other semantically related keywords, allowing the detection of the emerging topics, under user-specified time constraints. We provide different case studies which show the validity of the proposed approach.},

We utilize a player's gaming experience and objective to create a player profile. Utilizing this profile and a performance-based algorithm, the PADS customizes the game's difficulty levels to accommodate each individual. Our experimental results successfully demonstrate improvements in both perceptual and actual gaming experiences. With our approach, traditional program-centered video games can be transformed to provide individualized, player-centered gaming experiences.},
